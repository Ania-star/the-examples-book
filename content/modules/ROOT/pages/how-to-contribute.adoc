== Adding content

If you are interested in making a contribution to this book, the first step is to xref:git:github-desktop.adoc#install-github-desktop[install and configure GitHub Desktop]. Then, use the quick-start links provided below.

- <<adding-an-example, Adding an example>>
- <<adding-a-module, Adding a module>>
- <<adding-an-appendix, Adding an appendix>>

To learn more about how the book is organized, see <<organization, our organization section>>. To learn about and see some AsciiDoc examples, see <asciidoc, our AsciiDoc section>>.

=== Adding an example

=== Adding a module

=== Adding an appendix

What we are referring to as an "appendix", Antora calls a "component". If a particular topic is largely outside of the scope of The Data Mine curriculum for _most_ students, it may belong in an appendix instead. Adding an appendix to the book is straightforward. 

. Create a new repository with the following, minimal structure.
+
----
my_repo2
└── content
    ├── antora.yml
    └── modules
        └── ROOT
            ├── nav.adoc
            └── pages

4 directories, 2 files
----
+
. Fill in the content of the `antora.yml` configuration file. The following is an example of a minimal `antora.yml` file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
name: example-appendix
title: Example Appendix
version: 1.0.0
start_page: ROOT:introduction.adoc
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
Choose the `name` carefully. The `name` ends up appearing as the first value in the URL's path. For example: \https://the-examples-book.com/example-appendix/<version>/<page-name>.
+
. Create and place the desired AsciiDoc content in the `pages` directory. Make sure to follow our <<naming-convention, page naming convention>>.

. When you are satisfied with the results, modify the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] file in our https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book[primary repository], and create a Pull Request. This is as simple as adding another item to our menu:content[sources] section of the `.yml` file. For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
- url: https://github.com/my_organization/my_appendix_repo
  branches: "1.0.0"
  start_paths: content
----
+
All content incorporated into this book will be indexed and added to the search functionality by the maintainer.
+
[TIP]
Check out this book's https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] file and https://github.com/TheDataMine/scholar-appendix[scholar appendix] for more details.

== Organization

This book is organized into the **core book**, and **supplementary appendices**. 

The **core book** contains content we hope every student learns. For example, an code snippet showing how to read and write data to a file using Python, would most likely get added somewhere in the core book. 

**Supplementary appendices** are reserved for topics that are largely beyond the scope of The Data Mine curriculum for _most_ students. In certain cases, a corporate partner's team may be required to quickly learn about a topic. For example, perhaps a team is working on an app to translate natural language to an SQL query. In this scenario, a mentor may ask students to take a look at content in the NLP appendix. Before creating a Pull Request to add content, please take a moment to figure out _where_ that content most appropriately fits. When in doubt, please feel free to ask!

_Within_ the core book or an appendix, you will find a certain file structure.

The file structure is important. Special keywords in the provided example that should _not_ be modified are: 

<1> `content`
<2> `antora.yml`
<3> `modules`
<4> `ROOT`
<5> `attachments`
<6> `examples`
<7> `images`
<8> `pages`
<9> `partials`
<10> `nav.adoc`

[IMPORTANT]
While not specifically highlighted in the provided example, the `attachments`, `examples`, `images`, `pages`, and `partials` folders are examples of repeated keywords, or keywords that are reused in each module. While `nav.adoc` is not technically a special keyword, we would like to keep this consistent with all modules and appendices added to the book.

In addition, in the https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book[core book repository], you will find a file called https://github.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/blob/staging/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`] in the root of the repository. This file is responsible for pulling in all of the resources for the core book and all of the dependencies. 

[NOTE]
This book uses https://antora.org/[Antora] to render the online book. The following is a summary of information that can be found online. For a more in-depth look at Antora, please see the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[official documentation].

content:: 
This is a directory at the root-level of the repository which should contain the `antora.yml` file and a `modules` directory.

antora.yml::
This is a configuration file that contains information about the book or appendix contained within the sibling `modules` directory. At the time of writing, this is what the core book's `antora.yml` file looked like.

modules::
The directory containing (at a minimum) the `ROOT` module, and any other custom-named modules you would like. In our example we also had a `module1` module and a `module2` module.

ROOT::
The `ROOT` module. This is the default, required module. No further modules are required. An appendix or core book may not need more than the `ROOT` module. In fact, our https://github.com/TheDataMine/scholar-appendix[scholar appendix] only contains the `ROOT` module.

attachments::
A "family directory" that should be used to store binaries or other large files. These attachments can then be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

examples::
A "family directory" that should be used to store examples. For this book, examples will most likely be code snippets. In practice, any potentially reuseable code snippet should be added to the `examples` directory. This enables maintainers to update a code snippet once, and have it applied _everywhere_ it appears in the book. These examples can be referenced internally, and included in a code chunk. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

images::
A "family directory" that should be used to store all figures and images. For this book, we will require all images to be labeled `figureXXX` where `XXX` is a number starting at `001` and ending at `999`. These images can be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

pages::
A "family directory" that should be used to store each page of the book. These are AsciiDoc files. This is where the actual content lives.

[NOTE]
[[naming-convention]]include::partial$naming-convention.adoc[]

partials::
A "family directory" that should be used to store content snippets. Provided examples include common descriptions, terminology, or referenced tables. Any content that doesn't fit into a previously named "family directory", but will most likely be reused in multiple pages should be added as a _partial_ to the `partials` directory. Partials can be referenced internally. https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/#reference-syntax-id-requirements[See here.]

nav.adoc::
This folder contains a list of anchor links that end up as your navigation links in the menu on the left hand side of the book. For example, at the time of writing this, `modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` looked like this.

== AsciiDoc

This book is written using https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is an open and powerful format for writing notes, text documents, books, etc. It is easy to write technical documentation in AsciiDoc, and quickly convert the text to various mediums like websites, ebooks, pdfs, etc.

Below are a variety of AsciiDoc examples from https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[powerman]. To see how content is rendered, compare https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDataMine/the-examples-book/staging/content/modules/ROOT/pages/how-to-contribute.adoc[the adoc file for this page], to it's output below.

=== Tables

=== LaTeX

We use https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] to render LaTeX. Our current configurations allow inline equations using \$'s and display equations using \$\$'s. To escape a regular \$, you can prepend a \, so, for example, to write \$2.00 you would type `\$2.00`.

This is an example of an inline equation: $e=mc^2$

We've configured MathJax to _not_ process text in the following tags: `<script>`, `<noscript>`, `<style>`, `<textarea>`, `<pre>`, `<annotation>`, `<annotation-xml>`, and `<code>`.
