== AsciiDoc

This book is written using https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is an open and powerful format for writing notes, text documents, books, etc. It is easy to write technical documentation in AsciiDoc, and quickly convert the text to various mediums like websites, ebooks, pdfs, etc.

Below are a variety of AsciiDoc examples from https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[powerman].

== LaTeX

We use https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] to render LaTeX. Our current configurations allow inline equations using \$'s and display equations using \$\$'s. To escape a regular \$, you can prepend a \, so, for example, to write \$2.00 you would type `\$2.00`.

This is an example of an inline equation: $e=mc^2$

This is an example of a display equation: $$e=mc^2$$

We've configured MathJax to _not_ process text in the following tags: `<script>`, `<noscript>`, `<style>`, `<textarea>`, `<pre>`, and `<code>`.
