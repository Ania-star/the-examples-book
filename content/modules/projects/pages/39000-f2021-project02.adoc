= STAT 39000: Project 2 -- Fall 2021

== The (art?) of a docstring

**Motivation:** Documentation is one of the most critical parts of a project. https://notion.so[There] https://guides.github.com/features/issues/[are] https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html[so] https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis[many] https://www.gitbook.com/[tools] https://readthedocs.org/[that] https://bit.ai/[are] https://clickhelp.com[specifically] https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[designed] https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[to] https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html[help] https://pdoc.dev[document] https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor[a] https://swagger.io/[project], and each have their own set of pros and cons. Depending on the scope and scale of the project, different tools will be more or less appropriate. For documenting Python code, however, you can't go wrong with tools like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[Sphinx], or https://pdoc.dev[pdoc].

**Context:** This is the first project in a 2-project series where we explore thoroughly documenting Python code, while solving data-driven problems.

**Scope:** Python, documentation

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use Sphinx to document a set of Python code.
- Use pdoc to document a set of Python code.
- Write and use code that serializes and deserializes data.
- Learn the pros and cons of various serialization formats.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/apple/health/watch_dump.xml`

== Questions

The topics of this semester are outlined in the xref:book:projects:39000-f2021-projects.adoc[39000 home page]. In addition to those topics, there will be a slight emphasis on topics related to working with APIs. Each project this semester will continue to be data-driven, and will be based on the provided dataset(s). The dataset listed for this project will be one that is revisited throughout the semester, as we will be slowly building out functions, modules, tests, documentation, etc, that will come together towards the end of the semester. Of course, all projects that expect any sort of previous work will provide you with previous work in case you chose to skip any given project.

In this project we will work with pdoc to build some simple documentation, review some Python skills that may be rusty, and learn about a serialization and deserialization of data -- a common component to many data science and computer science projects, and a key topics to understand when working with APIs.

For the sake of clarity, this project will have more deliverables than the "standard" `.ipynb` notebook, `.py` file containing Python code, and PDF. In this project, we will ask you to submit an additional PDF showing the documentation webpage that you will have built by the end of the project. How to do this will be made clear in the given question.
