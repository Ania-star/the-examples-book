= STAT 19000: Project 13 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** It is always important to stay fresh and continue to hone and improve your skills. For example, games and events like https://adventofcode.com/[https://adventofcode.com/] are a great way to keep thinking and learning. Plus, you can solve the puzzles with any language you want! It can be a fun way to learn a new programming language.
