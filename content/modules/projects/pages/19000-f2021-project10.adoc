= STAT 19000: Project 10 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Functions are powerful. They are building blocks to more complex programs and behavior. In fact, there is an entire programming paradigm based on functions called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming[functional programming]. In this project, we will learn to apply functions to entire vectors of data using `sapply`.

**Context:** We've just taken some time to learn about and create functions. One of the more common "next steps" after creating a function is to use it on a series of data, like a vector. `sapply` is one of the best ways to do this in R.

**Scope:** r, sapply, functions

.Learning Objectives
****
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Utilize apply functions in order to solve a data-driven problem.
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
