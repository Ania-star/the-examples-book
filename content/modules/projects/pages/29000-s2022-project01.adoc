= STAT 29000: Project 1 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** Extensible Markup Language or XML is a very important file format for storing structured data. Even though formats like JSON, and csv tend to be more prevalent, many, many legacy systems still use XML, and it remains an appropriate format for storing complex data. In fact, JSON and csv are quickly becoming less relevant as new formats and serialization methods like parquet and protobufs are becoming more common.

**Context:** This is the first project in a series of 5 projects focused on web scraping in Python, with a focus on XML.

**Scope:** Python, XML

.Learning Objectives
****
- Review and summarize the differences between XML and HTML/CSV.
- Match XML terms to sections of XML demonstrating a working knowledge of the format.
