= STAT 39000: Project 13 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Containers are a modern solution to packaging and shipping some sort of code in a reproducible and portable way. When dealing with R and Python code in industry, it is highly likely that you will eventually have a need to work with Docker, or some other container-based solution. It is best to learn the basics so the basic concepts arenâ€™t completely foreign to you.

**Context:** This is the second project in a 2 project series where we learn about containers, and one of the most popular container-based solutions, Docker.

**Scope:** unix, Docker, Python, R, Singularity

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand the various components involved with containers: Dockerfile/build file, container image, container registry, etc.
- Understand how to push and pull images to and from a container registry.
- Understand the basic Dockerfile instructions.
- Understand how to build a container image.
- Understand how to run a container image.
- Use singularity to run a container image.
- State the primary differences between Docker and Singularity.
