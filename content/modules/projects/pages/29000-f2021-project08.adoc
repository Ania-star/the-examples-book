= STAT 29000: Project 8 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** 

**Context:** This is the third and final part in a series of projects that are designed to exercise skills around UNIX utilities, with a focus on writing bash scripts and `awk`. You will get the opportunity to manipulate data without leaving the terminal. At first it may seem overwhelming, however, with just a little practice you will be able to accomplish data wrangling tasks really efficiently.

**Scope:** awk, bash scripts, R, Python

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use awk to process and manipulate textual data.
- Use piping and redirection within the terminal to pass around data between utilities.
- Write bash scripts to automate potential repeated tasks.
