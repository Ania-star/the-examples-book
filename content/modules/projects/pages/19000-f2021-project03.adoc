== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/depot/datamine/data/olympics/*.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1

Use R code to print the names of the two datasets in the `/depot/datamine/data/olympics` directory.

Read the larger dataset into a data.frame called `olympics`.

Print the first 6 rows of the `olympics` data.frame, and take a look at the columns. Based on that, write 1-2 sentences describing the dataset (how many rows, how many columns, the type of data, etc.) and what it holds.

**Relevant topics:** list.files, file.info, read.csv, head

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- 1-2 sentences explaining the dataset.
====

=== Question 2

How many unique sports are accounted for in our `olympics` dataset? Print a list of the sports. Is there any sport that you weren't expecting? Why or why not?

**Relevant topics:** unique, length

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- 1-2 sentences explaining the results.
====

=== Question 3

Create a data.frame called `us_athletes` that contains only information on athletes from the USA. Use the column `noc` (National Olympic Committee 3-letter code). How many rows does `us_athletes` have?

Now, perform the same operation on the `olympics` data.frame, this time containing only the information on the athletes from the country of your choice. Name this new data.frame appropriately. How many rows does it have?

Now, create a data.frame called `both` that contains the information on the athletes from the USA and the country of your choice. How many rows does it have?

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- How many rows or athletes in the `us_athletes` dataset? 
- How many rows or athletes in the other country's dataset? 
- How many rows or athletes in the `both` dataset? 
====

=== Question 4

What percentage of US athletes are women? What percentage of US athletes with gold medals are women?

Answer the same questions for your "other" country from question (3).

**Relevant topics:** prop.table, table, indexing

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
====

=== Question 5

What is the oldest US athlete to compete based on our `us_athletes` data.frame? At what age, in which sport, and what year did the athlete compete in?

Answer the same questions for your "other" country from question (3) and question (4).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you using indexing to _only_ print the athlete's information (age, sport, year).
====

.Items to submit
====
- Code used to solve this problem.
- Output from running the code.
- Age, sport, and olympics year that the oldest athlete competed in, for each of your countries.

[WARNING]
====
_Please_ make sure to double check that your submission is complete, and contains all of your code and output before submitting. If you are on a spotty internet connection, it is recommended to download your submission after submitting it to make sure what you _think_ you submitted, was what you _actually_ submitted.
