= STAT 29000: Project 10 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Although SQL syntax may still feel unnatural and foreign, with more practice it will start to make more sense. The ability to read and write SQL queries is a "bread-and-butter" skill for anyone working with data.

**Context:** We are in the second of a series of projects that focus on learning the basics of SQL. In this project, we will continue to harden our understanding of SQL syntax, and introduce common SQL functions like `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

**Scope:** SQL, sqlite

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database over a tool like a spreadsheet.

- Basic clauses: select, order by, limit, desc, asc, count, where, from, etc.
- Utilize SQL functions like min, max, avg, sum, and count to solve data-driven problems.
