= STAT 29000: Project 9 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database. SQL can handle much larger amounts of data than R and Python can alone. SQL is incredibly powerful. In fact, https://cloudflare.com[Cloudflare], a billion dollar company, had much of its starting infrastructure built on top of a Postgresql database (per https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22878136[this thread on hackernews]). Learning SQL is well worth your time!

**Context:** There are a multitude of RDBMSs (relational database management systems). Among the most popular are: MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and SQLite. As we've spent much of this semester in the terminal, we will start in the terminal using SQLite.

**Scope:** SQL, sqlite
