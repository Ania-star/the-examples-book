== Sharing Python code: Virtual environments & git part I

**Motivation:** Python is an incredible language that enables users to write code quickly and efficiently. When using Python to write code, you are _typically_ making a tradeoff between developer speed (the time in which it takes to write a functioning program or scripts) and program speed (how fast your code runs). This is often the best choice depending on your staff and how much your software developers or data scientists earn. However, Python code does _not_ have the advantage of being able to be compiled to machine code for a certain architecture (x86_64, ARM, Darwin, etc.), and easily shared. In Python you need to learn how to use virtual environments (and git) to share your code.

**Context:** This is the first in a series of 3 projects that explores how to setup and use virtual environments, as well as some `git` basics. This series is not intended to teach you everything you need to know, but rather to give you some exposure so the terminology and general ideas are not foreign to you.

**Scope:** Python, virtual environments, git

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain what a virtual environment is and why it is important.
- Create, update, and use a virtual environment to run somebody else's Python code.
- Use git to create a repository and commit changes to it.
- Understand and utilize common `git` commands and workflows.
