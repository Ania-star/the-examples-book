= STAT 19000: Project 1 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** In this project we are going to jump head first into The Data Mine. We will load datasets into the R environment, and introduce some core programming concepts like variables, vectors, types, etc. As we will be "living" primarily in an IDE called Jupyter Lab, we will take some time to learn how to connect to it, configure it, and run code.

**Context:** This is our first project as a part of The Data Mine. We will get situated, configure the environment we will be using throughout our time with The Data Mine, and jump straight into working with data!

**Scope:** r, Jupyter Lab, Scholar, Brown

.Learning Objectives
****
- Read about and understand computational resources available to you.
- Learn how to run R code in Jupyter Lab on Scholar and Brown.
- Read and write basic (csv) data using R.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset

The following questions will use the dataset found in Scholar:

`/class/datamine/data/`

== Questions

=== Question 1

For this course, projects will be solved using 2 computing clusters: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/scholar[Scholar], and https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/brown[Brown]. 

Each _cluster_ is a collection of nodes. Each _node_ is an individual machine, with a processor and memory (RAM). Use the information on the provided webpages to calculate how many cores and how much memory is available _in total_ for both clusters, combined.

Take a minute and figure out how many cores and how much memory is available on your own computer. If you do not have a computer, provide a link to a common computer and provide the information for it instead.

.Items to submit
====
- A sentence explaining how many cores and how much memory is available, in total, for Brown and Scholar combined.
- A sentence explaining how many cores and how much memory is available, in total, for your own computer.

=== Question 2

In previous semesters, we've used a program called RStudio Server to run R code on Scholar and solve the projects. This year, we will be using Jupyter Lab almost exclusively. Let's being by launching your own private instance of Jupyter Lab using a small portion of the compute cluster.

Navigate and login to https://gateway.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu OR https://gateway.brown.rcac.purdue.edu using your Purdue Career Account credentials (and BoilerKey). You will be met with a somewhat intimidating screen, with lots of options. Don't worry, however, the next steps are very straightforward.

Towards the middle of the top menu, there will be an item labeled btn:[My Interactive Sessions], click on btn:[My Interactive Sessions]. On the left-hand side of the screen you will be presented with a new menu. You will see that there are a few different sections: Datamine, Desktops, and GUIs. Under the Datamine section, you should see a button that says btn:[Jupyter Lab], click on btn:[Jupyter Lab].

If everything was successful, you should see a screen similar to the following.

image::figure01.webp[OnDemand Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand Jupyter Lab"]

Make sure that your selection matches the selection in **Figure 1**. Once satisfied, click on btn:[Launch]. Behind the scenes, OnDemand uses SLURM to launch a job to run Jupyter Lab. This job has access to 1 CPU core and 3072 Mb of memory. It is OK to not understand what that means yet, we will learn more about this in STAT 39000. For the curious, however, if you were to open a terminal session in Scholar and/or Brown and run the following, you would see your job queued up.

[source,bash]
----
squeue -u username # replace 'username' with your username
----

After a few seconds, your screen will update and a new button will appear labeled btn:[Connect to Jupyter]. Click on btn:[Connect to Jupyter] to launch your Jupyter Lab instance. Upon a successful launch, you will be presented with a screen with a variety of kernel options. It will look similar to the following.

image::figure02.webp[Kernel options, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="Kernel options"]

There are 2 primary options that you will need to know about.

f2021-s2022::
The course kernel where Python code is run without any extra work, and you have the ability to run R code or SQL queries in the same environment.

[TIP]
====
To learn more about how to run R code or SQL queries using this kernel, see https://the-examples-book.com/book/projects/templates[our template page].
====

f2021-s2022-r::
An alternative, native R kernel that you can use for projects with _just_ R code. When using this environment, you will not need to prepend `%%R` to the top of each code cell.

For now, let's focus on the f2021-s2022-r kernel. Click on btn:[f2021-s2022-r], and a fresh notebook will be created for you. 

Test it out! Run the following code in a new cell. This code runs the `hostname` command and will reveal which node your Jupyter Lab instance is running on. What is the name of the node you are running on?

[source,r]
----
system("hostname", intern=TRUE)
----

[TIP]
====
To run the code in a code cell, you can either press kbd:[Ctrl+Enter] on your keyboard or click the small "Play" button in the notebook menu.
