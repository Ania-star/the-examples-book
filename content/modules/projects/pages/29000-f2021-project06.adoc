== The anatomy of a bash script

**Motivation:** A bash script is a powerful tool to perform repeated tasks. RCAC uses bash scripts to automate a variety of tasks. In fact, we use bash scripts on Scholar to do things like link Python kernels to your account, fix potential isues with Firefox, etc. `awk` is a programming language designed for text processing. The combination of these tools can be really powerful and useful for a variety of quick tasks. 

**Context:** This is the first part in a series of projects that are designed to exercise skills around UNIX utilities, with a focus on writing bash scripts and `awk`. You will get the opportunity to manipulate data without leaving the terminal. At first it may seem overwhelming, however, with just a little practice you will be able to accomplish data wrangling tasks really efficiently.

**Scope:** awk, bash scripts, UNIX utilities

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use awk to process and manipulate textual data.
- Use piping and redirection within the terminal to pass around data between utilities.
- Write bash scripts to automate potential repeated tasks.
