= STAT 19000: Project 1 -- Spring 2022

**Motivation:** Last semester each project was completed in Jupyter Lab from https://ondemand.brown.rcac.purdue.edu. Although our focus this semester is on the use of Python to solve data-driven problems, we still get to stay in the same environment. In fact, Jupyter Lab is Python-first. Now instead of using the `f2021-s2022-r` kernel, instead select the `f2021-s2022` kernel.    

**Context:** In this project we will re-familiarize ourselves with Jupyter Lab and its capabilities. We will also introduce Python and begin learning some of the syntax.

**Scope:** Python, Jupyter Lab 

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use Jupyter Lab to run Python code and create Markdown text.
- Gain exposure to some Python syntax.
