= STAT 19000: Project 9 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** A key component to writing efficient code is writing functions. Functions allow us to repeat and reuse coding steps that we used previously, over and over again. If you find you are repeating code over and over, a function may be a good way to reduce lots of lines of code!

**Context:** We've been learning about and using functions all year! Now we are going to learn more about some of the terminology and components of a function, as you will certainly need to be able to write your own functions soon.

**Scope:** r, functions

.Learning Objectives
****
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order, length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Demonstrate how to use tapply to solve data-driven problems.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in R.
