= STAT 19000: Project 12 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** In the previous project you were forced to do a little bit of date manipulation. Dates can be very difficult to work with, regardless of the language you are using. `lubridate` is a package within the famous https://www.tidyverse.org/[tidyverse], that greatly simplifies some of the most common tasks one needs to perform with date data.

**Context:** We've been reviewing topics learned this semester. In this project we will continue solving data-driven problems, wrangling data, and creating graphics. We will introduce a https://www.tidyverse.org/[tidyverse] package that adds great stand-alone value when working with dates.

**Scope:** r

.Learning Objectives
****
- Read and write basic (csv) data.

- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to create basic graphs with default settings.
- Demonstrate the ability to modify axes labels and titles.
- Incorporate legends using legend().
- Demonstrate the ability to customize a plot (color, shape/linetype).
