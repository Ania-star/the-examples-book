= STAT 19000: Project 1 -- Fall 2020

**Motivation:** In this project we are going to jump head first into The Data Mine. We will load datasets into the R environment, and introduce some core programming concepts like variables, vectors, types, etc. As we will be "living" primarily in an IDE called RStudio, we will take some time to learn how to connect to it, configure it, and run code.

**Context:** This is our first project as a part of The Data Mine. We will get situated, configure the environment we will be using throughout our time with The Data Mine, and jump straight into working with data!

**Scope:** r, rstudio, Scholar
