= STAT 29000: Project 11 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** Being able to use results of queries as tables in new queries (also known as writing sub-queries), and calculating values like `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` in aggregate are key skills to have in order to write more complex queries. In this project we will learn about aliasing, writing sub-queries, and calculating aggregate values.

**Context:** We are in the middle of a series of projects focused on working with databases and SQL. In this project we introduce aliasing, sub-queries, and calculating aggregate values using a much larger dataset!

**Scope:** SQL, SQL in R

.Learning Objectives
****
- Demonstrate the ability to interact with popular database management systems within R.
- Solve data-driven problems using a combination of SQL and R.
- Basic clauses: SELECT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DESC, ASC, COUNT, WHERE, FROM, etc.
- Showcase the ability to filter, alias, and write subqueries.
- Perform grouping and aggregate data using group by and the following functions: COUNT, MAX, SUM, AVG, LIKE, HAVING. Explain when to use having, and when to use where.
