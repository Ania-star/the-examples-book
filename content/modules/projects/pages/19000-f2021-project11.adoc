= STAT 19000: Project 11 -- Fall 2021

**Motivation:** The ability to understand a problem, know what tools are available to you, and select the right tools to get the job done, takes practice. In this project we will use what you've learned so far this semester to solve data-driven problems. In previous projects, we've directed you towards certain tools. In this project, there will be less direction, and you will have the freedom to choose the tools you'd like.

**Context:** You've learned lots this semester about the R environment. You now have experience using a very balanced "portfolio" of R tools. We will practice using these tools on a set of YouTube data.

**Scope:** R

.Learning Objectives
****
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Utilize apply functions in order to solve a data-driven problem.
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in R.
- Demonstrate the ability to use nested apply functions to solve a data-driven problem.
