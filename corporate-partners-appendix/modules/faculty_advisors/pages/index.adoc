= Faculty Advisors
Similar to Mentors, Advisors can play a critical role in the progress of the corporate project and therefore the development of the students. Unlike Mentors however, Advisors are NOT the project owner and should refrain from changing the project scope as well as approving or denying students contributions.

The best Advisors are great orators, facilitating discussions and promoting the positive evolution of ideas and provides technical knowledge to support these endeavors.

== Inventive Works
All project members (Purdue faculty advisors, The Data Mine staff, teaching assistants, students) working with a COMPANY sign a confidentiality agreement which allows for their respective compensation. This means that work related to the project remains with the COMPANY in all circumstances.

*Therefore, we request that Purdue University employees refrain from offering inventive works.* This allows staff to retain their IP with the goal of providing a challenging educational experience for the students to solve problems on their own (to the extent that they are capable at this point in their education and experience).

By having students come to their COMPANY for inventive support, the COMPANY (in its sponsor role) has the first opportunity to engage more closely with students. This provides additional perspectives into opportunities and challenges that might spur insights and inventions by staff of the COMPANY. This allows enhancement of the students' problem-solving experience and more visibility to the COMPANY for high-value opportunities.

A case can additionally be made that there is an advantage for COMPANY to understand the sources of student helps to minimize the possibility of restricted use information being introduced into the student's work (e.g., a university employee introducing restricted use information received from another university client).
