= The Data Mine of the Rockies Program
Fully Virtual Data Science Community for Colorado Students
v1.0, 2025-02-25

== Overview

The Data Mine of the Rockies is a fully virtual adaptation of Purdue University’s acclaimed Data Mine program. Designed exclusively for Colorado students, it is a living, learning, and research-based community created to introduce participants to data science concepts and equip them with the skills to solve real-world problems through data-driven research. In this online environment, members collaborate remotely—sharing ideas, analyzing data, and developing innovative solutions.

== Our Mission: Data Science for ALL

Open to students from any major, The Data Mine of the Rockies emphasizes inclusivity and accessibility. Participants will acquire some of the most sought-after skills by industry leaders and graduate programs. No prior computational background is required; the only prerequisite is a strong desire to learn data science in a rigorous yet welcoming virtual setting.

=== General Cohort // Seminar

This virtual seminar offers a supportive environment for students from all academic backgrounds who want to learn data science skills. Through hands-on, project-based learning, participants will work with computational tools to represent, extract, manipulate, interpret, transform, and visualize large datasets, while effectively communicating their insights.

Seminar is a 1-credit, project-based, learn-by-doing, and lecture-free course where students:
* Discover data science and professional development opportunities.
* Understand the difference between research computing and basic personal computing data science capabilities.
* Design efficient search strategies while acquiring new data science skills.
* Devise data science strategies to answer research questions.
* Apply data science techniques through collaborative project-based work.

== Virtual Experience

Leveraging state-of-the-art online collaboration tools and virtual classrooms, The Data Mine of the Rockies ensures that students from anywhere in Colorado can participate. The program integrates both synchronous and asynchronous learning methods to foster an interactive community where ideas and insights are shared freely.
