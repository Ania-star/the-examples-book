= TA Attendance Tracker Usage Guide

== 1. Set up
1. Download the excel workbook. Make sure to download with macros enabled. xref:attachment$TA_Documentation_Template.xlsm[Attendance Tracker]
2. On the roster sheet, input your students' names into column A. It will automatically populate to the other sheets.
3. Update attendance and participation for each sprint. The spreadsheet will give you a suggested "presence" grade for each student and help you complete mid-semester and final feedback.

_**Notes:** if you have more than 15 students, drag down all formulas on all sheets. The macro is explained in section 2._

== 2. Attendance & Participation Options

=== Lecture Sessions

Attendance: Present, Late, Absent, Camera Off

Participation: N/A (if Absent), Poor, Average, Good, Exceptional

=== Lab Sessions

Attendance: Present, Late, Absent

Participation: N/A (if Absent), Poor, Average, Good, Exceptional


_**Note:** The built‑in macro auto‑sets Participation to N/A when Attendance = Absent in lecture and lab._

== 3. Presence Grade Recommendation

Presence grades are _recommended_ by the spreadsheet based on attendance and participation counts:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Level | Condition | Attendance Count | Participation Flags | Points
|Unsatisfactory (50%) | Missed three or all meetings. | COUNTIF("Absent") >= 3 | — | 10/20
|Below Expectations (70%) | Missed two meetings. | COUNTIF("Absent") = 2 | — | 14/20
|Needs Improvement (85%) | Missed a meeting, does not use Camera, or lacks participation in meetings. | COUNTIF(Absent) = 1 or Camera Off>0 or Poor>0 | — | 17/20
|Meets Expectations (95%) | Attended all LEC and LAB meetings. Camera was on and participated actively in meetings | — | — | 19/20
|Exceeds Expectations (100%) | Attended all LEC and LAB meetings. Camera was on, participated in meetings and often led discussions, and demonstrates out of the box thinking. Works with peers outside of scheduled class time. | — | COUNTIF(Exceptional) ≥ 1 | 20/20
|===

You may use this recommended grade to assist in grading sprint report presence. Please use your own discretion when grading.

== 4. Mid-Semester & Final Feedback

Mid-semester Feedback (Sprints 1–4): Automatically tallies total Absences, Lates, Camera Off, Poor & Exceptional counts.

Final Feedback (Sprints 1–7): Extends the same tallies across all sprints.

You may use these summaries to assist in grading mid-semester and final feedback. Please use your own discretion when grading.

== 5. Note Keeping

In columns K-L, there is a section to keep notes. This is a place to keep general information relevant to student's participation and tasks and their progress.
