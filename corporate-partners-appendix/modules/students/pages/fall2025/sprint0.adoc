= Sprint #0


== Intro Video

In the Corporate Partners course, we don't have a first class with all 800+ students together in one space because teams start meeting immediately. Instead, we recorded a 5-minute video of the information we would share on the first class.

== Sprint Dates
In Agile methodology, a sprint is a block of time used for the development of a product. In The Data Mine, sprints are 2 week with the exception of sprint #0 that covers the first week. You can think of Sprint #0 as a "primer" to onboard you for the semester with background information and trainings before you jump into your first full sprint.

> Sprint #0: Monday August 25, 2025 - Friday August 29, 2025

== Sprint Tasks

NOTE: Sprint #0 has a lot of tasks to help aide with onboarding. In future sprints, plan to spend more time working on your project.

=== &#10003; AI & Data Handling Quiz

The Data Mine Corporate Partner experience has you interact with company data. Its important to know how to maintain data security especially, when it comes to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Data Mine Corporate Partners team has worked with your Mentor(s) to determine how AI can be used on your project. Below is is the 5-tiered AI use scale, which should appear in your team's Project Charter.

|AI Use Scale|Description|
|---|---|
|No AI| The project is completed entirely without AI assistance. This level ensures that students rely   solely on their knowledge, understanding, and skills. *AI must not be used at any point during the assessment.* |
| AI-Assisted Idea Generation and Structuring | AI can be used in the project for brainstorming, creating structures, and generating ideas for improving work. *No AI content is allowed in the final submission.* |
| AI-Assisted Editing | AI can be used to make improvements to the clarity or quality of student created work to improve the final output, but no new content can be created using AI. *AI can be used, but your original work with no AI content must be provided in an appendix.* |
| AI Task completion, Human Evaluation | AI is used to complete certain elements of the task, with students providing discussion or commentary on the AI-generated content. This level requires critical     engagement with AI generated content and evaluating its output. *You will use AI to complete specified tasks in your project. Any AI created content must be cited.* |
| Full AI | AI should b used as a “co-pilot” in order to meet the requirements of the assessment, allowing for a collaborative approach with AI and enhancing creativity. *You may use AI throughout the project to support your own work and do not have to specify which content is AI generated.*|
