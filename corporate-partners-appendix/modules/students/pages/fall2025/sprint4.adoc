.Data Storytelling
[%collapsible%open]
====
*What:* Watch the following video on linl:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_34YnCmMY[Storytelling with Data] and complete the reflection questions in Gradescope. The concepts discussed in this video, combined with the previous assignment, will be used to create your final presentation this fall.

*Why:* Data storytelling allows you to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that are meaningful to major stakeholders on your project. By weaving data into a narrative, you can engage your audience, highlight key points, and make complex information more accessible. This approach helps you effectively communicate your findings, persuade stakeholders, and drive informed decision-making.

.Addressing Different Audiences
[%collapsible%open]
====
*What:* Read this article about link:https://www.quanthub.com/how-to-identify-your-audience-for-impactful-data-storytelling/[How to Address Different Audiences] and complete the reflection in Gradescope.

*Why:* Your team will likely have a variety of people at your final presentations. Each will have a different amount of background knowledge about the project and will have different expectations for what they expect to get out of this project. It is important to recognize these differences and address them the best you can while presenting.

.How to Give a Strong Presentation
[%collapsible%open]
====
*What:* Watch this Ted Talk about link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU[How to Give a Strong Presentation] and complete the assignment in "Sprint 5: Professional Development". Make sure you watch until the end, as most of your assignment will be based on the Transformation Matrix.

*Why:* A high-quality final presentation is essential for your project's success in The Data Mine. The concepts in this video will help you build an outline for your team's presentation. We aim for these presentations to be professional, not only to impress our mentors but also to teach you how to create successful presentations in the real world.
