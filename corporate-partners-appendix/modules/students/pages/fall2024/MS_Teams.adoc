=== Accessing your Teams Group
When you register for a Corporate Partners Project, you will automatically be added to a MS Teams channel for that project. It may take about a day to register on the back end so please be patient. If you do not get added after 36 hours, please submit a ticket to datamine-help@purdue.edu.

Once you are in the MS Team channel, you will also be included in an Outlook email group. This email group keeps the history of _all_ emails exchanged from the associated email group. 

[NOTE]
====
Sending or replying to any message in this group will send it to the entire team.
