		<p><b>What: </b>Watch the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIOGenWu_iA&list=PLWG_vsmMJ2clEeGKVyrOIKlOYrjFnVKqa&index=7 " >Implicit Bias: Lesson #6 - Countermeasures </a> (5 minutes). </p>
<br>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Where: </b>Complete the reflection for this professional development training on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> in the assignment "Sprint 5: Professional Development".</p>
<br>
  </div>
    <p><b>Why: </b> The video discusses strategies to mitigate implicit bias, emphasizing mindset, debiasing, and decoupling. Mindset involves being humble and mindful of our biases. Debiasing focuses on reshaping biases through exposure to counter-stereotypical examples. Decoupling aims to implement structures and procedures that minimize bias in decision-making. These strategies are crucial for recognizing and addressing implicit biases, which are pervasive and impact behavior. Understanding and applying these methods is essential for promoting fairness and equity in various settings. </p>
