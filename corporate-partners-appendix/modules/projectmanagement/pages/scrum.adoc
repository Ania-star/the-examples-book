= Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight framework for teams to follow. This framework helps enable teams to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products such as software or research ideas. The five values of scrum are courage, focus, commitment, respect, and openness. These values define key points of scrum and scrum teams will practice these values in their development.

The difference between Scrum and Agile can be confusing. Remember, Agile is a project management philosophy that utilizes core principles for guidance. Scrum, however, is a specific Agile methodology that is practiced during project development.

Scrum has key components including sprints, roles, and ceremonies. These components are discussed in depth in future sections.
