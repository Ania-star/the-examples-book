= Scrum Ceremonies


== Important Definitions

*Sprint*: the building blocks of development under Scrum. They are short, time specific periods
where a team works to accomplish specific work and goals. In general, there are four key ceremonies
that make up sprints: sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

*Sprint Planning*: meeting time spent planning for the upcoming sprint including task ownership and xref:artifacts.adoc[increment] decisions

*Daily Scrums*: short (5-15 minute), daily check ins where each team member speaks very briefly on what they are working on and notify the team of any blockers they are facing

*Sprint Review*: a meeting held towards the end of a sprint to demo the xref:artifacts.adoc[increment] and reorganize the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] 

*Sprint Retrospective*: a meeting with the scrum team spent reflecting on what what went well during the previous sprint and what can be improved upon for next sprint 
 
== Ceremonies in The Data Mine
Using *scrum ceremonies* may be the single most important part of using scrum in The Data Mine. It is normal to seek structure in project development, but it is often very hard to find with research and development projects. Scrum ceremonies offer that structure.

By committing to a regular and consistent schedule, scrum teams will find themselves in a steady groove as the project unfolds. 

=== Sprint Planning

*Sprint planning* should take place at the start of every sprint. Realistically, planning meetings will occur at the first team meeting following the end of sprint. TAs are responsible for creating and maintaining the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] by working with their team’s corporate partner mentor to ensure they project is moving with correct pace and direction.

During the *sprint planning meeting*, an open discussion is held between the corporate partner mentors, TAs, and development team. Each development team member will take ownership of tasks from the xref:artifacts.adoc[product backlog] to complete the coming sprint. Each event that is chosen will then be moved to xref:artifacts.adoc[sprint backlog].

=== Sprint Review

*Sprint reviews* should occur once every sprint during a meeting time with the team’s corporate partner mentor in attendance. Team members will go around and informally demonstrate their work through live demos, documentation, or presentations. This meeting is where the corporate partner mentor can clearly see the work being done by the team and can give feedback to the team. It is crucial for the team to be prepared for these meetings on a sprint-by-sprint basis because it is direct representation of the work being accomplished. Feedback from the corporate partner mentor should be annotated and applied towards the next sprint.

=== Sprint Retrospective

*Retrospectives* in The Data Mine function as a standard retrospective. This ceremony will happen at the end of every sprint and is a time for reflection and evaluation of the sprint. This event can be held with or without a corporate partner mentor, and it is the TA’s responsibility to lead this ceremony.

====
Encourage honesty in the hope of continued improvement.

=== Sprint Schedule

The sprint start and end dates are slightly shifted depending on when a team has their lab (2 hours) and lecture (50 minutes).

This is so that sprints always start with a lec and follow the format lec-lab-lec-lab.

Because The Data Mine Corporate Partners experience is on an academic schedule, the typical sprint schedule used in industry must be modified. Here is an example of a sprint schedule in The Data Mine:

*Monday/Tuesday Meeting*: sprint planning meeting with corporate partner mentor

*Thursday/Friday Lab*: standup and working meeting

*Following Monday/Tuesday Meeting*: sprint review meeting with corporate partner mentor

*Following Thursday/Friday Lab*: standup, sprint retrospective, and working meeting

[IMPORTANT]
====
This schedule can be modified slightly, but it is most important for sprint planning meetings and sprint review meetings to be held with corporate partner mentors.
