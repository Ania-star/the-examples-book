= `tidyverse`

We work in the base R environment a lot, and while it serves our needs most of the time, technological process moves very quickly. Some aspects of R that were innovative at its inception are now outdated, so packages are increasingly used and created to enhance the functionality of our programming languages.

The word "Tidyverse" actually does have meaning -- the package itself is a uni**verse** of other packages that all share the goal of making data *tidy* (get it?), consisting of the following packages:

- https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/[ggplot2]
- https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/[dplyr]
- https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/[tidyr]
- https://readr.tidyverse.org/[readr]
- https://purrr.tidyverse.org/[purrr]
- https://tibble.tidyverse.org/[tibble]
- https://stringr.tidyverse.org/[stringr]
- https://forcats.tidyverse.org/[forcats]

Every page listed above comes directly from the https://www.tidyverse.org/[`tidyverse` website] (which we highly recommend), each of which containing a cheat sheet for its respective package. We'll talk about the sub-packages at varying lengths, but it's generally enough to know that the processes are `tidyverse` processes.

== Installation

If you don't already have `tidyverse` installed on your computer or environment, you can start using it with just two simple statements:

[source,R]
----
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
----
----
-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --
v ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   0.3.4
v tibble  3.1.6     v dplyr   1.0.9
v tidyr   1.2.0     v stringr 1.4.0
v readr   2.1.2     v forcats 0.5.1
-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
----

Look at that! The installation and loading of `tidyverse` is really just the installation and loading of the eight aforementioned packages.

== Resources

Much of being a good programmer and data scientist is knowing where to look for help. Try to always expand your knowledge and never be afraid to look for guidance. We've listed some of the best `tidyverse` resources there are:

- https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html[R for Data Science] -- a (free!) book that heavily relies on `tidyverse` to communicate its lessons. There's a good chance you'll find an answer in it, even if it's not the answer you thought you'd find.
- https://rpubs.com/aelhabr/tidyverse-basics[Intro to `tidyverse`] -- a blog post that does a good job of summarizing what you'll be working with.
- *This book!* -- shameless self-promo. We try to include lessons that let you master the basics of the relevant parts of the `tidyverse` upon which we test you. If you notice something that can be improved upon, feel free to xref:book:ROOT:how-to-contribute.adoc[make a contribution], post on Piazza, or email us at datamine@purdue.edu.
