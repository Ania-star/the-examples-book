= `between`

`between` is a simple function from `dplyr` that is an efficiently implemented shortcut for testing if an integer is in a certain range. For example:

[source,r]
----
x <- 5

print(x >= 4 && x <= 10)
----
----
 [1] TRUE
----

[source,r]
----
# instead, with dplyr, you can use between
between(x, 4, 10)
----
----
 [1] TRUE
----
