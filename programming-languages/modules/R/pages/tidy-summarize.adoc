= `summarize`

`summarize` is a useful function to get a new, tidy, data frame that is a summary of some other data. It's particularly useful in conjunction with `group_by`, when you want to compare groups.

Say you wanted to do the following:

* Create a new column called `Sepal.Length.Cat` with values `small` when `Sepal.Length` < 5.1, `large` when `Sepal.Length` >= 5.8, and `medium` otherwise.
* Get a summary containing the average `Sepal.Width` by `Sepal.Length.Cat` and `Species`.
* Get a summary containing the variation in averages for each `Species`.

You could accomplish all of that with one (piped) block of code:

[source,r]
----
iris %>% 
    mutate(Sepal.Length.Cat = case_when(
        Sepal.Length < 5.1 ~ "small",
        Sepal.Length >= 5.8 ~ "large",
        TRUE ~ "medium"
    )) %>%
    group_by(Sepal.Length.Cat, Species) %>%
    summarize(avg_sepal_width_grouped = mean(Sepal.Width)) %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarize(std_of_avgs = sd(avg_sepal_width_grouped))
----
----
 `summarise()` regrouping output by 'Sepal.Length.Cat' (override with `.groups` argument)
----
----
 `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

 # A tibble: 3 x 2
   Species    std_of_avgs
   <fct>            <dbl>
 1 setosa           0.402
 2 versicolor       0.329
 3 virginica        0.255

As you can see, it has some pretty powerful functionality that would be more difficult to replicate (and harder to read) using base R.
