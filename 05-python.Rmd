## Getting started {#getting-started-with-python}

### Python on Scholar {#python-on-scholar}

First, in order to run Python within https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, log in to https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/ and run the following:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

If at any point in time you are asked if you would like to install miniconda, select "No".

Each year we provide students with a working Python kernel that students are able to select and use from within https://notebook.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/ as well as within an Rmarkdown document in https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/. We ask that students use this kernel when completing all Python-related questions for the course. This ensures version consistency for Python and all packages that students will use during the academic year. In addition, this enables staff to quickly modify the Python environment for all students should the need arise.

Let's configure this so every time you access https://notebook.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/ or https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, you will have access to the proper kernel, and the default version of python is correct. Connect to Scholar, and on Scholar, run the following 

`source /class/datamine/apps/runme.sh`

If you already have a a Jupyter notebook running at https://notebook.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, you may need to refresh in order for the kernel to appear as an option in `Kernel > Change Kernel`.

To test if the kernel is available and working, open a notebook, click on `Kernel > Change Kernel`, and select the kernel matching the current year. For example, you would select `f2020-s2021` for the 2020-2021 academic year. Once the kernel has been changed, you can confirm the version of Python by running the following in a code cell:

```{python, eval=F}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

If you already have an Rstudio session running at https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, you may need to restart the R session by clicking `Session > Restart R`. 

To test if Python is working within https://rstudio.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu/, run the following in a Python code chunk:

```{python, eval=F}
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```

The python executable should be located in the appropriate folder in the following path: `/class/datamine/data/python/`.

If you would like to use the Python environment that is put together for this class, from within a terminal on Scholar, run the following:

```{bash, eval=F}
source /class/datamine/apps/python.sh
```
