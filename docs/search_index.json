I’m unable to connect to RStudio Server.", " FAQs How do I connect to Scholar from off-campus? There are a variety of ways to connect to Scholar from off-campus. You can use the ThinLinc web client, or setup a VPN connection to Purdue’s VPN, and connect using the ThinLinc client application. If you just want to use Jupyter notebooks, you can use JupyterHub. If you just want to use RStudio, you can use RStudio Server. Is there an advantage to using the ThinLinc client rather than the ThinLinc web client? Yes. Although it is marginally more difficult to connect with, the ThinLinc client allows the user to copy and paste directly from their native operating system. So for example, if you have an RStudio session opened on your MacBook, you can directly copy and paste code onto Scholar using the ThinLinc client. You are unable to do this via the ThinLinc web client. GitHub Classroom is not working – can’t authorize the account. This is usually a browser issue. GitHub Classroom does not work well with Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. Try Firefox or Safari or Chrome. In Scholar, my font size looks weird or my cursor is offset. In scholar, navigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance, and select the “Monospace” font, and click the “Apply” button. How do I make the ThinLinc window bigger without going to the dreaded “full screen” mode? See here. I’m unable to type into the terminal in RStudio. Try opening a new terminal, try clearing the terminal buffer, or interrupting the current terminal. All these options come from a menu that will pop up when you hit the small down arrow next to the words “Terminal 1” (it might be another number depending on how many terminals are open) which is on the left side right above the terminal in RStudio. I’m unable to connect to RStudio Server. Try closing it, clearing your cookies, and using the original link: https://rstudio.scholar.racac.purdue.edu/, or for ease of scrolling, try https://desktop.scholar.rcac.purdue.edu, and open up RStudio from within the ThinLinc web client.
