R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R is a highly powerful tool for statistical computing, graphics, and programming. As a free, open-source, and continually evolving software, it is widely recognized as a strong competitor among statistical and data science packages.
