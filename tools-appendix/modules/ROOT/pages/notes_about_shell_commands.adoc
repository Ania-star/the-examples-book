= Notes about Shell Commands

Okay, at this point you probably have a decent idea of how the terminal works. We give it a line of Bash code, we hit enter, and it runs the code. But what if I was to ask you *where* your terminal is running. That may seem like a bit of a nonsense question, so let's investigate over the course of the next two questions.

The terminal we are referring to is simply where you type your input and receive your output. The _shell_, however, is the entity that is actually running your code. If you were to open another terminal tab on Anvil, and then try and reference a variable you defined in the first tab, nothing would happen. This is because the two different tabs are different _shells_, and are largely self-contained (more on this in the future). For a more concrete example, each code cell with the `%%bash` cell magic uses its own shell. When you 'run' the cell, Anvil is really starting a new shell, feeding it all the lines of code it contains, and then 'killing' the cell upon the code completing. Because of this, you'll often find it useful to test and develop all your code in a terminal tab where your work will be preserved from line-to-line and then pasting your completed commands into a notebook cell for your final deliverable.

Let's examine this idea of separate shells in detail. Try running this code all in one cell:

[source, Python]
----
%%bash

fakecommand='echo foobar'
$fakecommand
----

Observe the results. Then, in a new code cell, run:

[source, Python]
----
%%bash

$fakecommand
----

Again, observe the results. You should notice that in the first cell, where we run `fakecommand='echo foobar'` to define a variable named fakecommand, when we run `$fakecommand` it is the same as running `echo foobar`. However, in the second code cell, nothing happens when we run `$fakecommand` because each cell creates its own shell each time it runs - that is to say, the `fakecommand` variable does not exist outside the cell it is defined in. Keep this in mind going forward, as it is a common source of bugs when using Bash with Jupyter notebooks.

The other notable new concept introduced in the above code is variables. In Bash, variables are not nearly as commonly used as in languages like Python or R (for reasons we'll discuss later in the course). However, they can still be useful at times. Defining variables in Bash generally takes the form of `variablename=value` or, if there are spaces in the `value` field, `variablename='value with spaces'`. Notice the single quotes around the value. This is so that our shell knows that everything within the quotes is part of the variable, and not something else on the same line. Bash has a lot of long, single-lined commands, so this is an important distinction. By running `$variablename`, we essentially run the code assigned as the value of that variable.

For an example hinting at the practicality of this, you can do something like below:

[source, Python]
----
%%bash

e="A very long string that we want to print a bunch of times but we don't have to write a bunch of times"
echo $e
echo $e
----

Pretty interesting! We can use variables to shorten long strings! The below code is one way you could find the location of the first letter 'Z' in a file, given the file's name. The third line of code shows an example of using it. For this question, assign the long filename to a variable called `FileName`, and then use the command on the file. Starter code has been provided below, and you only have to fill in the specified lines. You will know your code is correct if it prints the same thing twice.

Once this is working, run the command again, replacing the `'Z'` with a `'J'`. You should get different results.

[source, Python]
----
%%bash

# general structure of the command
grep -n -m 1 'Z' filename

# specific demo
grep -n -m 1 'Z' /anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv

# starter code
# [FILL IN THIS LINE WITH YOUR VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT]
grep -n -m 1 'Z' $FileName

# [FILL IN THIS LINE, REPLACING 'Z' with 'J']
----

[NOTE]
====
We will discuss the `-n -m` in more detail in the next few questions, along with having a whole project dedicated just to `grep`. For now, a comprehensive understanding of either of these is not necessary. Just try to get a feel for how commands are generally formatted.
