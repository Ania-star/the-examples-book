We will use SQLite in The Data Mine.  The https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html[SQLite webpage] provides a lot of http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html[documentation].  Here is a https://www.sqlite.org/about.html[succinct description] about SQLite.

If you like working on databases, it is likely that, at some point, you will also want to learn MySQL, which has many similarities to SQLite.  The http://www.mysql.com/[MySQL webpage] provides http://dev.mysql.com/doc/[extensive documentation].
