== Mike Piazza Batting Average

Calculate Mike Piazza's batting average during each year of his career.

[TIP]
====
A player's batting average during a season is the number of hits (`H`) divided by the number of times at bat (`AB`).  In 1998, his batting average was 0.328.  It is necessary to group the player's statistics within the year (e.g., in case they were traded during the year).  It is also necessary to cast either the hits or the at-bats (or both) as a floating point number (or real number); otherwise, when dividing two integers, the result will be an integer.
====


[source,SQL]
----
SELECT CAST(SUM(b.H) AS FLOAT)/SUM(b.AB), b.yearID FROM People as p JOIN Batting as b ON p.playerID = b.playerID WHERE nameFirst = 'Mike' AND nameLast = 'Piazza' GROUP BY b.yearID;
