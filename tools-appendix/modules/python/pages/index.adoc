Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus.

Python is largely known for its readability and versatility. Its design philosophy centers on clear and straightforward syntax, making Python accessible to both beginners and experienced coders. Over time, Python has evolved into a leading language in fields like data science and artificial intelligence (AI), largely thanks to its simplicity and extensive library support. Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are widely used for data manipulation and machine learning. Its versatility and large, active community allow for rapid development, which is essential in the fast-moving world of data science and AI.
