= Filtering and Selecting

== Basics and Simple Accessing Methods
It is implausible that you will always need an entire dataset when doing analysis, so being able to efficiently pick subsets of data is an important skill. `pandas` has some vital indexing functions that add logical parameters when working with a `DataFrame` or `Series`.

=== `[]` and `.`

Using brackets and periods to index in `pandas` are the most basic methods of indexing, and thus allow for simpler subset selection. Both are limited to *column* selection, so you won't be able to select the first row of an object with `df[1]` or `df.1`.

This indexing is done based on the column name -- if we had a column named "columnA", we could select it using `df['columnA']` or `df.columnA`.

Selecting multiple columns is also possible by nesting a list within your brackets: `df[['columnA', 'columnB', 'columnC']]`. This is _not_ possible when using `.` to select attributes -- you are additionally unable to use `.` to select:

* Columns that match names of `pandas` methods -- `max`, `head`, `describe`, etc.
* xref:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers[Identifiers], including keywords, whitespace, and literals. _If your column has a space in its name (which can happen often), you cannot select it with `.`_

=== Slicing

If we consider simple `[]` and `.` indexing to be column selection, we can consider `:` indexing to be row selection. You still start by using brackets, but when `:` is included, the *rows* are now selected instead of columns. _Only_ our rows can be selected when using simple slicing, but as you will soon see, slicing is a tool that is used heavily in more complex indexing.

`:` slicing is inclusive, with an implied 0 for the start and the object's last index implied for the end. Thus, the input `print(df[:])` selects all rows and is the same as `print(df)`. You can add a negative sign to the end index to _exclude_ the last n elements.

If you want to skip certain elements, you can add another colon after the stop index, which would take the following form: `df[0:4:2]`. There is an implied skip of 1 (meaning no skip at all), meaning `print(df[:]) == print(df[::]) == print(df)`. You can add a negative sign in front of the skip parameter to slice the object in reverse order.

=== `isin()`

The `isin` method (derived from *is in*) is a `pandas` method that mirrors the `in` keyword in other programming languages. It's a `Series` method that is passed a list (or list-like object), returning `True` or `False` depending on the value's inclusion in the list.

The potential applications are simple to imagine -- what if I only wanted to select certain states from a `DataFrame` containing information on the United States? How about information when the records include the day of the week, and I only want Mondays and Thursdays? These desires are very easily translated into code.

[source,python]
----
days = pd.Series(['Monday', 'Thursday', 'Wednesday', 'Saturday', 'Saturday', 'Monday'])
print(days.isin(['Monday', 'Thursday']))
----
----
0     True
1     True
2    False
3    False
4    False
5     True
----

[source,python]
----
print(days[days.isin(['Monday', 'Thursday'])])
----
----
0      Monday
1    Thursday
5      Monday
----

`DataFrames` have their own `isin` method, but as we'll demonstrate in the next section, using the `Series` method is better when combined with the `loc`/`iloc` functions.

=== Examples

For the following, we use the code `np.random.randn(num_rows, num_columns)` to generate a random `DataFrame`. The point is not for the output values to match, but rather the rows/columns.

== Multi-dimensional Indexing: `loc` and `iloc`


Fortunately, there are many ways to select multiple dimensions for subsetting, and they generally allow conditionals to further specify the data points you want.

The `loc` method allows for label-based indexing, while `iloc` is primarily integer-based. These are two of the best functions to use when indexing, so we'll be using plenty of examples to demonstrate their versatility.

We can use either `loc` or `iloc` to isolate a single column or `Series`. The differences between the two are strict; if you try to use row/column indices for `loc` or row/column names with `iloc`, you'll get an error.

There are many ways to select and view data from a pandas DataFrame. We will use the following dataset(s) to understand filtering and selecting:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`



**Indexing Options with DataFrame**


The following table comes from the O'Reily textbook _Python for Data Analysis:_
[cols="2*"]
|===
^|Type ^|Notes
^|`df[columns]` 
| Select single column or sequence of columns from the DataFrame; special case conveniences: Boolean array (filter rows), (slice rows), or Boolean DataFrame (set values based on some criterion)

^|`df.loc[rows]` 
| Select single row or subset of rows from the DataFrame by label

^|`df.loc[:, cols]` 
| Select single colum or subset of columns by label

^|`df.loc[rows, cols]` 
| Select both row(s) and column(s) by label

^|`df.iloc[rows]` 
| Select both row(s) and column(s) by label

^|`df.iloc[:, cols]` 
| Select both row(s) and column(s) by integer position

^|`df.iloc[rows, cols]` 
| Select both row(s) and column(s) by integer position

^|`df.at[row, col]` 
| df.iat[row, col]

^|`reindex method` 
| Select either rows or columns by labels
|===

== Extracting Rows/Columns from the DataFrame


Let's use our dataset to try the first indexing option.

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv")
----


[source,python]
----
myDF['ResidentStatus']
----

The output of selecting one columns using `[]` is a pandas Series:
----
0          20
1           1
2           1
3           1
4           1
           ..
2631166     3
2631167     3
2631168     3
2631169     4
2631170     3
Name: ResidentStatus, Length: 2631171, dtype: int64
----

If we wanted to extract multiple columns we, can use a list of the column names inside the double brackets `[[]]. 


[source,python]
----
myDF[['ResidentStatus', 'Age']]
----
The output of selecting multiple columns using the double brackets is a pandas DataFrame:

----
ResidentStatus 	Age
0 	1 	87
1 	1 	58
2 	1 	75
3 	1 	74
4 	1 	64
... 	... 	...
2631166 	3 	84
2631167 	3 	74
2631168 	3 	7
2631169 	4 	49
2631170 	3 	39

2631171 rows Ã— 2 columns

== The loc function 
DataFrames in pandas allow for label-based indexing and integer-based indexing. The `loc` function is for **label-based indexing**. 

In our dataset, our rows are integers, so we can use integers as our row labels. 

[source,python]
----
myDF.loc[0, 'Age']
----

----
87
----

== The iloc function 

The `iloc` function allows us to do **integer-based indexing** (an easy way to remember this is that the i in iloc stands for integer!)

For example, let's select `ResidentStatus` of the very first observation (index 0). 

[source,python]
----
myDF.iloc[0, 1]
----

----
1
----

Now let's select multiple columns of the first obervation: 

[source,python]
----
myDF.iloc[0,1:10]
----

----
