= Matplotlib with the Vehicles Database

This example is based on question 5 from TDM 102 Project 2 Spring 2024.

These example(s) depend on the database:

* `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv`


This dataset consists of vehicle listings sourced from Craigslist.org. It includes comprehensive information provided by Craigslist on car sales, featuring details such as price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 additional categories.

Find more about the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data[here]. 


[WARNING]
====
For the example below, you need to use 3 cores in your Jupyter Lab session.  If you started your Jupyter Lab session with only 1 core, just close your Jupyter Lab session and start a new session that uses 3 cores.  Otherwise, your kernel will crash when you load the data.

We added a video about https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/anvil/starting-an-anvil-session[starting an anvil session with more cores]

== Barplot with Vehicles Dataset

Plot a bar chart that illustrates the number of vehicles in each state, whose price is strictly lower than $6000. The bar chart should show the number of each of these vehicles in each state.

[source,python]
----
mydf = pd.read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv",index_col=0)
----

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
subDF = mydf[mydf['price']<6000]
cars_by_states = subDF.groupby('state').size()
cars_by_states.plot(kind = 'bar',figsize = (10,16))
plt.title("Cars under $6000 numbers by state")
plt.xlabel("State")
plt.ylabel("numbers of cars")
plt.xticks(rotation = 45)
plt.show()
