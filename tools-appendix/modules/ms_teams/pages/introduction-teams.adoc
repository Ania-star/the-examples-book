== What is Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams is the collaboration platform of The Data Mine that brings together chat, video meetings, file storage, and app integrations in one place.  Teams helps instructors, TAs, mentors, and students:

* **Communicate** in persistent threaded chats or real-time video calls   
* **Share & co-edit** documents, OneNote notebooks, and other resources directly in the interface  
* **Integrate** third-party apps like Kanban Board without leaving Teams  

== Core Concepts

=== Teams & Channels  
* **Team:** A grouping of people (e.g., “Data Mine – Fall 2025”)  
* **Channel:** A sub-group within a Team (e.g., `TAs-only`)  

=== Tabs  
Each Channel can have multiple **Tabs** (OneNote, Files, Planner, Power BI, etc.) that surface key resources without forcing users to leave Teams.

=== Permissions & Roles  
* **Owners** have full control: add/remove members, manage settings, create Private channels  
* **Members** (students/TAs) can participate in chats, meetings, and file edits  
* **Guests** (external mentors) have restricted access but can join meetings and view files if invited
