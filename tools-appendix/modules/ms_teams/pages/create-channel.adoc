= Creating a Separate Channel in Microsoft Teams

== Why Create a Separate Channel?
A dedicated channel lets you:
* Keep sprint-specific or topic-specific discussions organized.
* Limit access to a subset of students, mentors, or TAs.
* Separate private files and chat threads from the main team.

== Step-by-Step Instructions
. **Open your Team in MS Teams**

+
. **Add a New Channel**  
  At the top-right of the *Channels* tab, click **+ Add**.
. **Name & Describe**  
  *Channel name* → use something concise (e.g., `Student Discussion Board`).  
  *Description* → add context so members understand the channel’s purpose.

. **Choose Privacy Level**
  * *Standard* – visible to everyone in the team.  
  * *Private* – visible only to selected members.  
  _(For student-only collaboration spaces, choose **Private**.)_
. **Select Members**  
  If you chose *Private*, search for and add the specific students, mentors, or TAs who need access.
. **Create**  
  Click **Create**. Teams builds the channel and provisions its own Files tab and conversation space.
. **Manage**
  As an owner managing the channel after creation, you can add and remove members and delete the channel.

== Tips & Best Practices

* Create another channel as a **discussion board**. Encourage students to frequently post, share ideas, or plan team events.
* **Limit the number of channels** to avoid clutter; archive or hide inactive ones after the semester.
* **Permissions:** Only Owners can create Private channels unless you loosen team-wide settings.
* Use **@mention** inside the new channel to notify added members the first time you post.
