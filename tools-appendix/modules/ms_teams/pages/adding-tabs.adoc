= Adding Tabs in Microsoft Teams

== 1. Why Add a OneNote Tab?
* Central place for meeting notes, action items, and research snippets.  
* Real-time collaboration—everyone edits the same page.  
* Content is automatically stored in the Team’s SharePoint library.

== 2. Adding the Tab

. **Navigate to the Channel**  
  Go to the channel where you want shared notes

+
. **Click + (Add a tab)**  
  Located at the top of the channel next to existing tabs.
. **Choose “OneNote”**  
. **Create a new notebook** – Give it a clear name such as `Team_Notebook_Fall2025`. 
. The OneNote tab will appear; all channel members have edit access.

== 5. Tips & Best Practices
* **Tag to-dos** using the *To-Do* checkbox in OneNote; filter them later under *Tags Summary*.  
* **Pin Important Pages**: Right-click a page → *Copy link to this page* → paste as a tab if it needs top-level visibility.  
* **Search** (Ctrl + F) works across the entire notebook—handy during live Q&A.  
* **Adding Tabs** only adds a tab to the channel it is added in, not all channels of the team.
