= Recommended File Organization Structure

== Why a Standard Structure?
A clear, shared folder layout keeps mentors, TAs, and students aligned, prevents “lost” files, and speeds up onboarding for new team members in the second semester.
Create these folders in the **Files** tab of your main team channel before the first meeting.

== How to Set It Up

+
. Click **New → Folder** and create each **root-level** folder shown above.  
. Inside *Meeting-Presentations+Notes*, pre-create sub-folders `Sprint01`, `Sprint02`, … `Sprint07`.  
. Inside *Student-Work*, ask each student or sub-team to create a personal sub-folder on day 1.  
. Move any starter templates from staff into *DataMine-Materials*.

== Tips & Best Practices

* **Pin critical folders** (right-click → *Pin to top*) so students see them immediately.  
* **Access control:** If mentors need a private space, create a *Private* channel rather than burying files in hidden folders.  
* **Descriptive filenames:** Be clear when naming files to avoid confusion with similar files.
* **Autosave & History** are on by default—students can restore older versions themselves.
