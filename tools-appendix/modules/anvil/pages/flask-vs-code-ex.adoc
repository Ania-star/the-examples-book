= Getting Started with Flask and Visual Studio Code on Anvil
:toc:

This example comes from Project 13 from Spring 2024 TDM 102. 

**Motivation:** Flask is a web application framework that provides tools, libraries, and technologies to build a web application.

**Context:** In this guide, you'll create a simple conceptual webpage using `Flask`.

**Scope:** Python, Flask, Visual Studio Code

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a development environment for building a web application on Anvil
- Develop skills and techniques to create a webpage using `Flask` and `Visual Studio Code`
****

== Step-by-Step Guide

=== Step 1: Set Up Visual Studio Code on Anvil

. Follow the instructions from the https://the-examples-book.com/tools/anvil/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide] to launch VS Code on Anvil.

. Complete the Initial Configuration of VS Code and install the Python extension.

. Select the Python interpreter path:  
`/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3`

. Open a new terminal in VS Code and confirm the Python interpreter path by running:

+
[source, bash]
----
which python3
----

You should see `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3` as the output.
+

[TIP]
====
Launch VS Code on Anvil with the following options:

- Allocation: `cis220051`
- CPU Cores: `1`
- Starting Directory: `Home Directory`

If prompted with "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?", click **Yes, I trust the authors**.
====

[TIP]
====
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting[Code Editing in Visual Studio Code] to learn how to edit and run code.
====

=== Step 2: Create and Run a Simple Python Script

. In VS Code, create a Python file named `helloWorld.py`.

. Add a simple greeting:

+
[source, python]
----
print("Hello, world!")
----
+

. Run the file in the terminal:

+
[source, bash]
----
python3 helloWorld.py
----


=== Step 3: Build a Basic Flask Application

. Create a new Python file and enter the following code:

+
[source, python]
----
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8050, debug=True)
----
+

. Run the Python file. A message will appear indicating that your application is running on port 8050.

[NOTE]
====
- Click **"Open in Browser"** in the popup to view your app.
- You may need to change the port number if itâ€™s already in use (e.g., 8051, 8052).
- At this point, you'll receive a 404 error because a route hasn't been defined yet.
====

=== Step 4: Add a Route to Display a Message

. Modify your Flask code to define a route for the homepage (`'/'`):

+
[source, python]
----
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8050, debug=True)
----
+

. Re-run the Python file and refresh your browser to see the message.

[TIP]
====
To stop the server, click into the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
====

=== Step 5: Use an HTML Template for the Homepage

. In your project folder, create a directory named `templates`.

. Inside the `templates` folder, create a file named `index.html`:

+
[source, html]
----
<html>
<head>
    The head of my example page.
</head>
<body>
    Greetings from Dr Ward and Cookie Monster!
</body>
</html>
----
+

. Update your Flask app to use the `render_template` function:

+
[source, python]
----
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('index.html', name=name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8050, debug=True)
----
+

. Run the Python file again and open the browser to view the rendered HTML.

[TIP]
====
Ensure that the `index.html` file is inside a `templates` directory located in the same directory as your Python file.

Example path:  
`/home/x-mdw/templates/index.html`
====

You now have a basic understanding of how to launch VS Code on Anvil, create and run a Flask app, define routes, and serve HTML content using templates!
