== Stealing Bases for Several Teams

For this question, first find the teamID, yearID, and playerID for players who stole 40 or more bases for an individual team in an individual season, during the years since 1901.

Then use this table as a subquery, to find the players who achieved this feat for at least 5 distinct teams during their career.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT teamID, yearID, playerID FROM Batting WHERE (SB >= 40) AND (yearID >= 1901);

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT teamID) as mycounts, playerID FROM (SELECT teamID, yearID, playerID FROM Batting WHERE (SB >= 40) AND (yearID >= 1901)) GROUP BY playerID HAVING mycounts >= 5;
