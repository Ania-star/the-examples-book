== Strikeouts for Batters and Pitchers

Strikeouts are good for pitchers but bad for batters.  During the 2014 season, which pitcher had the most strikeouts, and how many strikeouts did they have?  Which batter had the most strikeouts, and how many strikeouts did they have?  (It is OK to just find the `playerID` for this pitcher and this batter.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT playerID, SO FROM Pitching WHERE yearID = 2014 ORDER BY SO DESC LIMIT (1);

SELECT playerID, SO FROM Batting WHERE yearID = 2014 ORDER BY SO DESC LIMIT (1);

== At Least One Complete Game In A Year

In recent years, it is rare for pitchers to throw a complete game.  For this question, in each year, consider only the pitchers (from the Pitching table) who pitched at least 1 complete game (in other words, who have `CG > 0`).  In each year, how many players achieved this feat, i.e., had at least one complete game?

[NOTE]
====
In 1871, there were 14 such pitchers, and in 2023, there were 25 such pitchers, but the number changed a lot over the years.
====

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*), yearID FROM Pitching WHERE CG > 0 GROUP BY yearID;

== Cy Young Award

Which pitcher has received the `Cy Young Award` the most times altogether?  How many times did he receive this award?  It suffices to just find this pitcher's `playerID`.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) as mycounts, playerID FROM awardsplayers WHERE awardID = 'Cy Young Award' GROUP BY playerID ORDER BY mycounts DESC LIMIT 1;
----


== Journeymen

The term journeyman is one "who plays for numerous clubs during his career":

see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_(sports)

Make a list of all of the pitchers who have played for 12 or more teams during their careers.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT teamID) as mycounts, playerID FROM Pitching GROUP BY playerID ORDER BY mycounts DESC LIMIT 15;
