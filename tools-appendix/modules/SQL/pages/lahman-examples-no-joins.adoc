[source,SQL]
----
SELECT * FROM parks WHERE state = 'IN';
----

== Characteristics of Cal Ripken Jr.

Cal Ripken Sr. and Cal Ripken Jr. both had long careers with the Baltimore Orioles:

`SELECT * FROM People WHERE nameFirst = 'Cal' AND nameLast = 'Ripken' LIMIT 5;`

Find Cal Ripken Jr.'s weight, height, and whether he bats left or right handed.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT weight, height, bats FROM People WHERE playerID = 'ripkeca01' LIMIT 5;
----



== Roberto Clemente

Find the number of at-bats, home runs, and stolen bases for Roberto Clemente (`playerID = 'clemero01'`) by year, given in ascending order according to the year.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT yearID, AB, HR, SB FROM Batting WHERE playerID = 'clemero01' ORDER BY yearID;
----


== Hall Of Fame Inductions

Find the number of players inducted into the Hall Of Fame each year since 2000.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT h.yearID, COUNT(*) FROM HallOfFame h WHERE h.yearID >= 2000 AND h.inducted = 'Y' AND h.category='Player' GROUP BY h.yearID;
----



== Ichiro Suzuki

Ichiro Suzuki is regarded as one of the greatest hitters of all time because of his prowess in both American and Japanese professional baseball.  Find the number of hits (`H`) and home runs (`HR`) for Ichiro Suzuki (`playerID = suzukic01`) during each year of his career.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT teamID, yearID, H, HR FROM batting WHERE playerID == 'suzukic01';
----

Notice that he was traded in 2012, so if we want his total number of hits (`H`) and home runs (`HR`) in each year, we need to group the values together, according to the yearID.  In such a case, it no longer makes sense to list the `teamID` because he has multiple `teamID` values in 2012.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT yearID, SUM(H), SUM(HR) FROM batting WHERE playerID == 'suzukic01' GROUP BY yearID;
----

This story about Iris Skinner and Ichiro Suzuki is one of my favorite baseball stories:

----



== Hall of Fame Veterans Committee

The Hall of Fame Veterans Committee nominates Hall of Fame players that are forgotten, so to say, in baseball history.

----





== Florida teams

There are only two teams from Florida, namely, the Marlins (who have played as the Florida Marlins and now as the Miami Marlins, with `franchID = 'FLA'`) and the Rays (who have played as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and now as the Tampa Bay Rays, with `franchID = 'TBD'`).  Considering only these two teams, find their attendance in each year, with all Marlins results given first (in ascending order by year) and then all Rays results given second (in ascending order by year).

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT yearID, franchID, attendance FROM teams WHERE franchID = 'TBD' OR franchID == 'FLA' ORDER BY franchID, yearID;
----


== Toronto Blue Jays Attendance

Sometimes a baseball team plays in different stadiums, for instance, due to a stadium renovation or due to the COVID pandemic.  Consider the Toronto Blue Jays (`teamkey = 'TOR'`) attendance, as described in the `Homegames` table.  Notice that there are multiple rows for the `yearkey` values 1989, 2001, 2021.  Now `SUM` the values for each `yearkey`, to get the total attendance in each year.  List your results according to the `yearkey`, in descreasing order.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT yearkey, SUM(attendance) FROM homegames WHERE teamkey = 'TOR' GROUP BY yearkey ORDER BY yearkey DESC;
----

== Strikeouts for Batters and Pitchers

Strikeouts are good for pitchers but bad for batters.  During the 2014 season, which pitcher had the most strikeouts, and how many strikeouts did they have?  Which batter had the most strikeouts, and how many strikeouts did they have?  (It is OK to just find the `playerID` for this pitcher and this batter.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT playerID, SO FROM Pitching WHERE yearID = 2014 ORDER BY SO DESC LIMIT (1);

SELECT playerID, SO FROM Batting WHERE yearID = 2014 ORDER BY SO DESC LIMIT (1);

== At Least One Complete Game In A Year

In recent years, it is rare for pitchers to throw a complete game.  For this question, in each year, consider only the pitchers (from the Pitching table) who pitched at least 1 complete game (in other words, who have `CG > 0`).  In each year, how many players achieved this feat, i.e., had at least one complete game?

[NOTE]
====
In 1871, there were 14 such pitchers, and in 2023, there were 25 such pitchers, but the number changed a lot over the years.
====

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*), yearID FROM Pitching WHERE CG > 0 GROUP BY yearID;
----




== Cy Young Award

Which pitcher has received the `Cy Young Award` the most times altogether?  How many times did he receive this award?  It suffices to just find this pitcher's `playerID`.

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) as mycounts, playerID FROM awardsplayers WHERE awardID = 'Cy Young Award' GROUP BY playerID ORDER BY mycounts DESC LIMIT 1;
----


== Most World Series

----
SELECT COUNT(*) as mycounts, franchID FROM Teams WHERE WSWin = 'Y' GROUP BY franchID ORDER BY mycounts DESC LIMIT 1;
----




== Most Runs Batted In

In the 2023 season, find the batter with the most runs batted in.  It suffices to simply find their `playerID`.

[NOTE]
====
In the `Batting` table, the runs batted in are found in the `RBI` column.
====

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT playerID, SUM(RBI) as mysum FROM Batting WHERE yearID = 2023 GROUP BY playerID ORDER BY mysum DESC LIMIT 1;
----



== Catchers Who Won the Gold Glove Award More Than Once In Their Careers

The Gold Glove award recognizes players with excellent fielding abilities.  Identify the catchers who have been recognized with this award more than once in their careers.

== Very Successful Manager in the 1990s

For this question, consider only games player during the 1990s.
Find the `playerID` for each manager who won at least 60 percent of their games.  Because there are some managers who were involved in only a few games, include the criteria that the managers was in more than 100 games during this time period.

[NOTE]

There was only one such manager to achieve this feat in the 1990s.
====

----
SELECT CAST(SUM(W) AS FLOAT)/(SUM(W)+SUM(L)) as myrecord, playerID, SUM(W), SUM(L)
FROM managers
WHERE yearID BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999

HAVING myrecord > 0.6 AND SUM(W) + SUM(L) > 100
ORDER BY myrecord DESC;
----



== Journeymen

The term journeyman is one "who plays for numerous clubs during his career":
