== Batting and Pitching

Strikeouts are good for pitchers but bad for batters.  During the 2014 season, which pitcher had the most strikeouts?  Which batter had the most strikeouts?  Be sure to get their full names.

----
SELECT p.nameFirst, p.nameLast, t.playerID, t.SO FROM Pitching as t JOIN People as p ON p.playerID = t.playerID WHERE t.yearID = 2014 ORDER BY t.SO DESC LIMIT (1);

SELECT p.nameFirst, p.nameLast, b.playerID, b.SO FROM Batting as b JOIN People as p ON p.playerID = b.playerID WHERE b.yearID = 2014 ORDER BY b.SO DESC LIMIT (1);



== AwardsPlayers

Which pitcher has received the `Cy Young Award` the most times altogether?  How many times did he receive this award?

== Pitching

In recent years, it is rare for pitchers to throw a complete game.  For this question, in each year, consider only the pitchers (from the Pitching table) who pitched at least 1 complete game (in other words, who have `CG > 0`).  In each year, how many players achieved this feat, i.e., had at least one complete game?  (Hint:  In 1871, there were 14 such pitchers, and in 2023, there were 25 such pitchers, but the number changed a lot over the years.)

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*), yearID FROM Pitching WHERE CG > 0 GROUP BY yearID;
