== Pitching

In recent years, it is rare for pitchers to throw a complete game.  For this question, in each year, consider only the pitchers (from the Pitching table) who pitched at least 1 complete game (in other words, who have `CG > 0`).  In each year, how many players achieved this feat, i.e., had at least one complete game?  (Hint:  In 1871, there were 14 such pitchers, and in 2023, there were 25 such pitchers, but the number changed a lot over the years.)

----
SELECT COUNT(*), yearID FROM Pitching WHERE CG > 0 GROUP BY yearID;
