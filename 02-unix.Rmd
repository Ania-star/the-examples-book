### `cat` {#cat}

`cat` stands for concatenate and print files. It is an extremely useful tool that prints the entire contents of a file by default. This is especially useful when we want to quickly check to see what is inside of a file. It can be used as a tool to output the contents of a file and immediately pipe the contents to another tool for some sort of analysis if the other tool doesn't natively support reading the contents from the file.

A similar, but alternative UNIX command that incrementally shows the contents of the file is called `less`. `less` starts at the top of the file and scrolls through the rest of the file as the user pages down.

### `head` {#head}

`head` is a simple utility that displays the first _n_ lines of a file, or input.

```{bash, eval=F}
head -n5 input.txt
```

Alternatively:
```{bash, eval=F}
cat input.txt | head -n5
```

### `ls` {#ls}

### `cp` {#cp}

### `mv` {#mv}

### `pwd` {#pwd}

### `touch` {#touch}

### `uniq` {#uniq}

`uniq` reads the lines of a specified input file and compares each adjacent line and returns each unique line. Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent. What this means is you must sort prior to using `uniq` if you want to ensure you have no duplicates.

### `wc` {#wc}

You can think of `wc` as standing for "word count". `wc` displays the number of lines, words, and bytes from the input file.

"*" stands for 0+ of the previous character.
"+" stands for 1+ of the previous character.
"?" stands for 0 or 1 of the previous character.
"{n}" stands for exactly n of the previous character.

```{bash, eval=F}
# Fully matches any word like "cat", "bat", "hat", "rat", "pat", "mat", etc.
# Does NOT match "at".
grep -i ".at" .
```

```{bash, eval=F}
# Matches any word like "cat", "bat", "hat", "rat", "pat", "mat", etc.
# Matches "at" as well. Does NOT fully match "spat".
grep -i ".?at" .
```

```{bash, eval=F}
# Full matches any word that ends in "at". For example, "spat". Does not fully match "spatula".
grep -i ".*at" .
```

```{bash, eval=F}
# Only matches words that end in "at": "bat", "cat", "spat", "at". Does not match "spatula" at all.
grep -i ".*at$" .
```

```{bash, eval=F}
# Matches lines that contain consecutive "e"'s.
grep -i ".*e{2}.*" .
```

```{bash, eval=F}
# Matches any line. 0+ of the previous character, which in this case is the wildcard "."
# that represents any character. So 0+ of any character.
grep -i ".*"
