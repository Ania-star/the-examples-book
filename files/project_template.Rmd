### Question 1

This is an example of a question where we need to include R code.

```{r, linewidth=80}
# Here is some R code.
my_variable <- c(1,2,3)
my_variable
```

### Question 2

This is an example of a question where we need to include UNIX commands.

```{bash, linewidth=80}
# Here are some bash commands.
ls | wc -w
```

### Question 3

This is an example where we just use some simple Markdown.

- First item
- Second item

You can find a link [here](https://datamine.purdue.edu/).

### Question 4

This is an example of a question where we need to include Python code.

**Important note:** Make sure to run the `datamine_py` function prior to running a Python code chunk.

```{python, linewidth=80}
import pandas as pd

dat = pd.read_csv('/class/datamine/data/amazon/amazon_fine_food_reviews.csv')
dat.head()
```

### Question 5

This is an example of a question where we need to use SQL from within R.

```{r, linewidth=80}
library(RSQLite)

# This is where we define and initiate a connection.
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "/class/datamine/data/chinook/chinook.db")

# We can then use the connection to run queries.
dat <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;")
head(dat)
```

Alternatively, you can use `con` to run SQL directly in a code chunk.

```{sql, connection=con, linewidth=80}
SELECT Name FROM tracks LIMIT 5;
```
