### Question 1

I can export to these formats:

.txt
.fake
.etc

### Question 2

The output from running the following code is: "Not telling"

```{python}
from thedatamine import hello_datamine
hello_datamine()
```

### Question 3

The output from using the `help` function on `hello_datamine` is: "Note telling"

```{python}
help(hello_datamine)
```

I can modify the code to get a customized message like this:

```{python}
from thedatamine import hello_datamine
hello_datamine() # This still needs to be customized...
```

This is where I would explain how I modified the code to get a customized message...

### Question 4

I would leave question (4) blank, or put a message like "done" here.

### Question 5

Then I can continue to answer the next questions...
