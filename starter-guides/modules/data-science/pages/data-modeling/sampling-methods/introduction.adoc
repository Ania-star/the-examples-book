= Sampling Methods

Sampling is the process of taking some amount of observations from a total possible dataset. For instance, imagine we are calculating average incomes across everyone who lives in the United States. To sample this, we would take n=1000 tax returns from 1 year, and get the average of those. Then, if we do that 1000 times, weâ€™ve only looked at 1,000,000 tax returns, but have taken 1000 averages. But how do we determine how to draw these samples? For instance, we could select them by which one has the highest income on it- this would make our average income much higher than it should be! We should try to select them randomly, but how do we chunk up data so that we can resample and train correctly?
