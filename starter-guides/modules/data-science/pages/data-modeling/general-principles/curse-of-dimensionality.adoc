= Curse of Dimensionality

== Introduction

The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the difficulties in modeling high dimensional data. A *dimension* refers to the features, or variables: the things we are measuring. Traditionally, the Curse of Dimensionality wasn't an issue because n, the number of observations (data points) was far greater than p, the number of dimensions. Imagine we are measuring the statistical distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) throughout hundreds of thousands of people. We determine the features, or dimensions, we really need are age, height, weight, and sex; that is, p=4. Let's say we get a big study of 200,000 people, that is, 200,000 observations. In this case we have n much much larger than p.
