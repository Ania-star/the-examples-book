= Protein Sequence Embedding

In the https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/data-science/data-analysis/nlp/word-embeddings(Word Embeddings Starter guide page) you learned how embeddings can be used to capture the relationships between words. But how do we use embeddings to capture the relationship between... proteins? One way to think of this is that biology speaks in a language too, such as with genetic changes over long periods of time. Protein sequence embedding is a way to infer the biological properties of protein sequences using machine learning. We can then predict potential new protein sequences while at the same time optimising their biological properties.
