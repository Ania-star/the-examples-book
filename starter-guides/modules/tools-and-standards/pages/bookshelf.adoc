= The Data Mine's Bookshelf

WARNING: This page is still under construction. For now, you might find short hand names of the books. We are working on listing all the Purdue library links here. If you look up any of these books on Purdue's library (which anyone can do, even non Purdue students) you will almost certainly find the book. 

While most of these books are scattered throughout the Starter Guides on their respective topics, they are also listed here under their approximate content domain. All of these books come highly recommended. For Purdue students, most if not all of these books are free at the Purdue library link; for non-Purdue students, a good chunk of them should be free.
