= Data Mine Container Tag Library

Here is a list of all the image tags we have available (that are referenced below as <specific-project-tag-name>). xref:containers/using-data-mine-containers.adoc[The Data Mine Containers Starter Guide] has the full details on how to use these tags, but in general the container image/tag syntax is

----
ghcr.io/thedatamine/starter-guides:<specific-project-tag-name>
----

So for instance, if we wanted to pull the introductory neural networks container, we would do

[source,bash]
----
docker pull ghcr.io/thedatamine/starter-guides:neural-nets-intro
----

== The List

WARNING: This list is a work in progress. We periodically update this list so we have all the container tags in one public spot, so you might find that some pages are updated that have tags which haven't been updated here yet.

* neural-nets-intro
* web-scraping-intro
* train-valid-test
* k-means-clustering
* time-series-rnn
