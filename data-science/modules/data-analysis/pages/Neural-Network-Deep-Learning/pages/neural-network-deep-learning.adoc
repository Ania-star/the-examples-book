= Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Neural networks are a type of modeling technique that was inspired by neuronal transmission in animal brains. Neural networks are often deployed when the suspected solution is nonlinear!LINK TO GOOGLE; that is to say, a line probably won't represent the expected answer. Deep learning is neural networks with two or more layers.

== Common Applications

Neural networks originally were used to solve pattern recognition problems (similar to the MNIST dataset, which can be found in the code projects below).!LINK TO ISL! Neural networks tend to benefit in predictive/inferential power as datasets get larger, so very large datasets often utilize neural networks. Computer vision (especially in a healthcare context), classification problems, and speech & natural language processing have all seen intensive use of neural networks in the past 20 years.

However, the amount of data we are collecting on everything is increasing in general; hence neural networks are becoming an increasingly common choice strictly because of their ability to perform better as dataset size increases.

=== Books

Also known as the "machine learning bible", this book is very well known and highly recommended and very clear, and has numerous code projects attached with each chapter. Chapter 10 is the deep learning chapter.

This book is great for people who have experience with neural networks, but want to get a better feel for the math/theory background. A calculus and linear algebra background is necessary to make sense of this book.
