== 1. How many tables are in the SQL database?

One method is to load the SQL database

[source,sql]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb.db
----

and select the names of the tables, as we explained in the introduction to the course.  There are six tables:  `akas`, `crew`, `episodes`, `people`, `ratings`, `titles`

[source,sql]
----
%%sql
SELECT
    name
FROM
    sqlite_master
WHERE
    TYPE IN('table', 'view')
    AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%'
ORDER BY
    1;
