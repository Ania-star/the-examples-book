<b>introduction to the R platform</b><br>
<br>
Starting point for many R resources: <a href="http://www.r-project.org">The R Project for Statistical Computing</a><br>
<br>
<!--Mirrors for downloading R: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a><br>
<br>-->
<!--Download links for installing R: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/banner.shtml">Downloads for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows</a><br>
<ul>
<li>for <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>,
choose the "snowleopard.pkg" link if you have Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7. 10.8, or
choose the "mavericks.pkg" link if you have Mac OS X 10.9.  To see which version of Mac OS X you have, go to the upper-left-hand corner of your Mac, click on the Apple, and choose About This Mac.
<li>for <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/">Windows</a>,
choose the "base" link, and then click on the link at the top of the page to "Download R for Windows".
</ul>-->
Some helpful resources; you will find which ones suit you best (we are all open to feedback on these resources; please make suggestions if you want to add some here):
<ul>
<li><a href="R.html">some R books and papers</a>
<li><a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/">R-help archives</a>
<li><a href="http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/">Help for R</a>

<b>examples of plots</b><br>
<br>
R has powerful graphical capabilities, which are easy to use:
<a href="videos/exampleplots.mp4">video of some example plots</a>.<br>
This video also shows how to install packages in R.
When it becomes necessary, it will be helpful to see all <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html">Contributed Packages</a> from CRAN.<br>
To install packages (for example, here, the mapproj and then the maps package), type:<br>
install.packages("mapproj")<br>
install.packages("maps")<br>
and then the R software will ask which mirror you want.  Afterwards, the package will be installed.<br>
Installations of packages only need to be done one time.<br>
It is necessary, however, to load a package at the start of every session where you want to use it, for instance:<br>
library(maps)
<br>
<hr>
<b>using R as a calculator</b><br>
<br>
R can be used as a calculator:

<b>opening files we worked on earlier, in Rstudio</b><br>

<br>
<hr>
<b>the structure of the llc computer server</b><br>
<br>
Where should I store my files and folders?  How are things structured on llc?<br>
Here is a <a href="notes/llcstructure.pdf">picture of the llc structure</a>,
and two videos that explain this structure:<br>
<a href="videos/llcstructure1.mp4">video about the picture of the structure</a>
<br>
and<br>
<a href="videos/llcstructure2.mp4">video that demonstrates moving around the llc computer's directories</a>.<br>
If you want to save files into your group directory from within Rstudio itself,<br>
here is a third resource, namely, a <a href="videos/llcstructure3.mp4">video about using Rstudio to save files in the right place</a><br>
Here are the two sample files used in the video above: <a href="notes/samplefile.R">samplefile.R</a> and <a href="notes/samplefile2.R">samplefile2.R</a>

<b>introduction to built-in data sets in R</b><br>
<br>
R has some built-in data sets.  We take a brief look at the co2 data, including some ways to use different ways to index this data:<br>

<br>
<hr>
<b>data types</b><br>
<br>
R has several kinds of data types:
<ul>
<li>scalar (can be logical, integer, double, complex, character, raw, and a few others...)
<li>vector (1 dimensional), matrix (2 dimensional), and array (multidimensional)
<li>factor (ordered sequence of data; the possible values are called levels)
<li>data frame (two dimensional data structure, where each column has the same length but different columns can have different types of data)
<li>list (an ordered collection of objects)
<li>formulas (used to show how variables are related)
<li>time series (data collected at several (usually uniform) points in time)
<li>shingles (typically used in lattice)
<li>dates and times
<li>connections (these allow R to communicate outside of the R platform)
</ul>
<hr>
<b>missing values</b><br>
<ul>
<li>NA indicates a missing value
<li>NaN means "not a number"
<li>Inf and -Inf mean positive and negative infinity, respectively
<li>NULL is the null object
</ul>
