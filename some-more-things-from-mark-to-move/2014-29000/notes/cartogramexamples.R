# This is something like what you wanted to do.  I made two changes, however.
# I scaled by the max of the projsPercent instead of by the sum of projsPercent
#   This scaling will not affect the cartogram shape at all, because all values are scaled the same amount.
#   However, I also chose the hsv colors according to the "s" factor instead of the "h" factor,
#      so that the more intense colors come with the high numbers of the goodprojvalues.
