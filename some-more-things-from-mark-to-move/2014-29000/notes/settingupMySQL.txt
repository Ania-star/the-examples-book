The first 6 chapters of the book Learning SQL provide a nice introduction
to SQL and MySQL:

*************************************************************

The Lahman database we will use is from this website:

http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

*************************************************************

First setup a MySQL account.  Read the instructions here, to get started:

https://www.purdue.edu/apps/ics/a/MySQLAccount

*************************************************************

NOTE:  Your login for your MySQL account will be the same username as for
your Career account (e.g., mdw is Dr Ward's username),
BUT the password for your MySQL account must be different than for your MySQL account.

After you read the instructions, you can click here to setup your MySQL account:

http://www.itap.purdue.edu/infrastructure/database/mysql/careeraccount.html

*************************************************************

Then log on to maven.itap.purdue.edu to use MySQL.
To do this, go to a terminal and type:

ssh maven.itap.purdue.edu

(I.e., you will be working on the "maven" computer at ITaP,
since llc does not have a MySQL server installed.)

*************************************************************

To download the examples from the book, once you get logged onto maven, then type:

wget examples.oreilly.com/learningsql/LearningSQLExample.sql

To download the examples from the baseball database, type these two lines:

wget seanlahman.com/files/database/lahman-sql_2014-08-13.zip

unzip lahman-sql_2014-08-13.zip

*************************************************************

Now the MySQL files for the book and for the baseball database
are both in your "maven" account, BUT they have not been imported into MySQL yet.

*************************************************************

Now log on to the MySQL server from maven, by typing:

mysql -h mydb.itap.purdue.edu -p

OR if you prefer to save all of your input and output to a file,
you can type INSTEAD the following (for example), and you will 
get all of your input and output saved to a file called myoutputfile.log
BUT please be aware that you need to change this file name each time,
or you will write over the previous output file from your earlier session,
next time you log in to your MySQL server.

mysql -h mydb.itap.purdue.edu -p --tee myoutputfile.log

For the password, use the password that you selected above, when
you set up your MySQL account.  (Do not use your Career password.)

Then type:

use mdw;

but of course use your own username instead of mdw.

*************************************************************

Type the following to import the book database and the baseball
database into your MySQL account:

source LearningSQLExample.sql;

source lahman2013.sql;

To see the tables in your account, type:

SHOW TABLES;

The 11 tables from the Learning SQL examples are:

account
branch
business
customer
department
employee
individual
officer
product
product_type
transaction

The tables from the Lahman database are described here;
this readme file was created by the maintainers
of the Lahman database, not by Dr Ward:

*************************************************************

When you are finished working on the MySQL assignment, you can:

Type "exit" (without quotes) at the mysql> prompt to get off MySQL.
Then type "exit" again (without quotes) to log off "maven".

*************************************************************
*************************************************************

Next time you want to log on to the MySQL server, things will be easier,
because everything will be all setup for you already.

You will first log on to maven.itap.purdue.edu to use MySQL.
To do this, go to a terminal and type:

ssh maven.itap.purdue.edu

Then you will log on to the MySQL server from maven, by typing:

mysql -h mydb.itap.purdue.edu -p

OR you could use something like this:

mysql -h mydb.itap.purdue.edu -p --tee myoutputfile.log

BUT again please remember to pick a different output file name each time,
so that you avoid deleting your previous output file, when you start a new session.

For the password, use the password that you selected above, when
you set up your MySQL account.  (Do not use your Career password.)

Then type:

use mdw;

but of course use your own username instead of mdw.
Now you are ready to work.  For instance, if you type:

SHOW TABLES;

you should see your tables all setup, and ready to go!

*************************************************************

# If you want to see each table (one at a time), you can try the
# following individual statements.

SELECT * FROM account;
SELECT * FROM branch;
SELECT * FROM business;
SELECT * FROM customer;
SELECT * FROM department;
SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM individual;
SELECT * FROM officer;
SELECT * FROM product;
SELECT * FROM product_type;
SELECT * FROM transaction;

# We can also see the format of each table by typing, for instance,
# the following individual statements.

DESC account;
DESC branch;
DESC business;
DESC customer;
DESC department;
DESC employee;
DESC individual;
DESC officer;
DESC product;
DESC product_type;
DESC transaction;

*************************************************************

When you are finished working on the MySQL assignment, you can:

Type "exit" (without quotes) at the mysql> prompt to get off MySQL.
Then type "exit" again (without quotes) to log off "maven".
