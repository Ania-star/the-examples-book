http://llc.stat.purdue.edu/2018/29000/nps.R

http://llc.stat.purdue.edu/2018/29000/billboard.R

(Dr. Ward will discuss these in class.)

Discuss, as a group, a website whose contents you would like to download. Study the html from the website, and work with Dr. Ward and Tyler to download the contents from the site. Your project should include a download of several hundred webpages within the site.


== Project 8

Question 5.

a.  Lookup the top 1000 boy and girl baby names from 2017 on this webpage:
https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/

b.  Save the html of the resulting webpage.  (This is necessary because it is rendered by a CGI script, so we cannot easily scrape the data on the fly from this webpage; instead, we must download the page first.)

c.  From this saved html file, scrape the top 100 boy names and the top 100 girl names.
