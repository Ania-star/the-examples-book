== Project 5

Question 5.

The goal of this question is to scrape the Hot 100 chart from Billboard. This chart is posted every Saturday. The first chart is here:

http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-08-09

and the most current chart is here:

http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2016-10-08

Use the system and either the wget or curl command, inside R, to scrape all of these charts (in XML format) into the <strong>scratch</strong> folder for your team.

Hint: It might be helpful to use the sapply and paste commands, as well as the `seq.Date` help page. After you have scraped all of the charts in XML format, then zip the results into one file, so that you can use them during a later project.

It is NOT NECESSARY to extract the titles and artists for the songs in the database. Just download the 3000+ webpages from the web (each one in XML), and we'll come back later to this data, to scrape the titles and artists, and do some analysis. For now, we just want to download the data files.

Solution:

[source,r]
----
v <- seq(as.Date("1958-08-09"), as.Date("2016-10-08"), by="week")
mycommands <- sapply(v, function(x) 
  paste("curl www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/", x, " >", x, sep="") )
sapply(mycommands, system)

== Project 6


During Project 5, question 5, you scraped the data from all of the BillBoard charts. In this project, you can have freedom to explore questions about the data.
To scrape the information from the first Hot 100 chart, you can use XPath. First it is necessary to install XPath.

[source,r]
----
install.packages("XML",repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("XML")
----

Then it is necessary to parse the XML source.

`mydoc <- htmlParse("/Users/mdw/1958-08-09")`

Now you are able to make queries about the XML content in a page. For instance,

[source,r]
----
mysongs <- xpathSApply(mydoc, "//*/div[@class='chart-row__title']/h2[@class='chart-row__song']", xmlValue)

Question 1.

a. Write a function that takes one date as input, and it extracts the song titles for that week.

b. Use the sapply and the unlist function to get a vector of all of the song titles for all of the weeks.

c. Write a function that takes one date as input, and it extracts the artists for that week.

d. Use the sapply and the unlist function to get a vector of all of the artists for all of the weeks.

Hint: It might be helpful to use:

`mydates <- seq(as.Date("1958-08-09"), as.Date("2016-10-08"), by = "week")`

Question 2.

Take your data from Question 1 and build a `data.frame` with four columns: the artists, the songs, the weeks, and the rank within the week. You will need to build another function to extract the positions.

Questions 3-10.

Ask 8 questions about the Billboard data, and answer each question, using the data.frame that you have built. It would be nice to make some visualizations about the data, for some of your questions. Have fun!



== Project 10

Summarize what you have learned in the course, as follows:

Please find some data on the web that you are interested in (as a group; this will take some initial discussion and agreement).

Scrape data for this project from the web in XML format, and then parse the data using XML tools, and finally design 6 questions about the data, and answer all 6 of your questions.

Since we are focusing on large data, I would like you to (please) have at least 2 million pieces of data in the set that you scrape.  You are certainly welcome to have more than 2 million pieces of data.

You can handle this, I know it for sure!  (For comparison, the airline data set had about 120 million pieces of data.)

I would also request (please) that, once you identify your website with your 2 million (or more) pieces of data, you run your project idea by me.  OK?

Once you have identified your website, and you run your project idea by me, I will ask you to scrape the data from the web, and parse it.  Then you should design 6 or more interesting questions about the data, and answer each of the 6 questions.

At the end, your group will submit the following to me:

The code for scraping the data from the web, and the code for parsing the data, and the 6 questions you designed about the data, and the answers to the 6 questions.

The due date for Project 10 is the end of the final week of classes, i.e., by the end of the day on Friday, December 9.  (We don't have a final exam, of course.)  I just want you to be done with this project before the final exams start, so that it doesn't get in the way of your exams.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Enjoy!
