== Project 7

Question 9.

a.   Use the `seq` and `as.Date` commands to build a list of dates, one per week, starting at "1958-08-04" and ending at "1961-12-25". Save these dates into a vector.

b.   Use the `seq` and `as.Date` commands to build a list of dates, one per week, starting at "1962-01-06" and ending at "2017-11-11". Save these dates into a vector.

c.   Use the vector from 9a, along with the `paste` command, to build another vector whose first entry is:

`wget billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-08-04`

and whose last entry is:

`wget billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1961-12-25`

and everything in between is what you would expect.

d.   Use the vector from 9b, along with the `paste` command, to build another vector whose first entry is:

`wget billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1962-01-06`

and whose last entry is:

`wget billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2017-11-11`

and everything in between is what you would expect.

10.   Run the system command on every element of the vector in 9c, using the `sapply` function.  Before doing this, be sure to use the Session menu, "Set Working Directory", to set your current working directory to your scratch space. This will take awhile to complete, but it will also help prepare us for the questions in Project 8. Then run the system command on every element of the vector in 9d.


== Project 8

Question 1.

During Project 7, you scraped the data from the BillBoard Hot 100 charts. In this project, you can have freedom to explore questions about the data. (There are 3094 Hot 100 charts.)

You can also explore the Top 200 album charts. (There are 2832 Top 200 album charts.)

For consistency, the data for both sets of charts is in your project 8 scratch folder already. You merely need to unzip both files that you will find there.

To scrape the information from the first Hot 100 chart, you can use XPath. First it is necessary to install XPath.

[source,r]
----
install.packages("XML",repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("XML")
----

Then it is necessary to parse the XML source.

`mydoc <- htmlParse("/scratch/scholar/m/mdw/proj8/billboardhot100/1958-08-04")`

Now you are able to make queries about the XML content in a page. For instance,

[source,r]

mysongs <- xpathSApply(mydoc, "//*/div[@class='chart-row__title']/h2[@class='chart-row__song']", xmlValue)

Did it work?

Yes, that works!

Question 1.

a. Write a function that takes one date as input, and it extracts the song titles for that week.

b. Use `sapply` to utilize the function that you wrote, on each of the data files. You might choose to use the `simplify=F` option with `sapply`, or you might prefer to keep the `simplify=T` option (which is the default). Then reshape the data, e.g., by using the `unlist` function, or the `matrix` function (or any similar method that you like), to extract all of the song titles for all of the weeks.

c. In a similar way, write a function that takes one date as input, and it extracts the artists for that week.

d. Use `sapply` to extract all of the artists for all of the weeks.

Question 2.

Take your data from Question 1 and build a data.frame with four columns about the Hot 100: the artists, the songs, the weeks, and the rank within the week.

Question 3.

Re-work Questions 1 and 2 for the Top 200 Albums charts. If necessary, you are allowed to ignore the first 214 weeks of the Top 200 Albums charts, since they do not have all 200 results. Build a data.frame with four columns about the Top 200 Albums: the artists, the albums, the weeks, and the rank within the week.

Questions 4-12.

Ask 9 questions about the Billboard data, and answer each question, using the data.frame that you have built. It would be nice to make some visualizations about the data, for some of your questions. Have fun!

Each student in the group should design three questions individually, OR students should work together on designing these questions, BUT the contributions from each student should be made clear in the project solutions.


== Project 9

Summarize what you have learned in the course, as follows:

Please find some data on the web that you are interested in (as a group; this will take some initial discussion and agreement).

Scrape data for this project from the web in XML format, and then parse the data using XML tools, and finally design 6 questions about the data, and answer all 6 of your questions.

Since we are focusing on large data, I would like you to (please) have at least 2 million pieces of data in the set that you scrape.  You are certainly welcome to have more than 2 million pieces of data.

You can handle this, I know it for sure!  (For comparison, the airline data set had about 120 million pieces of data.)

I would also request (please) that, once you identify your website with your 2 million (or more) pieces of data, you run your project idea by me.  OK?

Once you have identified your website, and you run your project idea by me, I will ask you to scrape the data from the web, and parse it.  Then you should design 6 or more interesting questions about the data, and answer each of the 6 questions.

At the end, your group will submit the following:

The code for scraping the data from the web, and the code for parsing the data, and the 6 questions you designed about the data, and the answers to the 6 questions.

The due date for Project 10 is the end of the final week of classes, i.e., by the end of the day on Friday, December 8.  (We don't have a final exam, of course.)  I just want you to be done with this project before the final exams start, so that it doesn't get in the way of your exams.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Enjoy!
