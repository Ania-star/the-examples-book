== Project 3

Question 1.

This question asks about the individual campaign contributions, as reported on the FEC website:

http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml

Scroll down to the table for 2015-2016 Data Files if you want to see this data. There is some information about the data here:

http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividuals.shtml

The data for "Contributions by Individuals" was downloaded from September 4, 2016.

This data is stored on the llc machine in the directory `/data/public/election2016/itcont.txt`

On which day of the election season were the average donations (by dollar amount) the largest?

Solution:

`myDF <- read.delim("/data/public/election2016/itcont.txt", sep="|", header=F)`

The average donations were the largest on September 16, 2014.

`sort(tapply(myDF$V15, myDF$V14, mean))`


Question 2.

a. On which 10 days of the campaign were the largest number of donations made?

b. On which 10 days of the campaign were the largest dollar amounts of donations made?

Solution:

a. The largest number of donations were made on these 10 days, e.g., the most donations were made on December 31, 2015

`tail(sort(table(myDF$V14)), 10)`

b. The largest dollar amounts of donations were made on these 10 days, e.g., the most donations were made on June 30, 2015

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15, myDF$V14, sum)), 10)`


Question 3.

a. How many donations were made by people who declared themselves to be Purdue employees?

b. How many of those donations came from Purdue employees who live in West Lafayette?

c. Among all Purdue donations from 3a, which campaign account received the largest number of donations?

Solution:

a. There were 1277 donations by people at Purdue.

`length(grep("PURDUE", myDF$V12))`

b. Among those donations, 599 of them were made by residents of West Lafayette.

[source,r]
----
v <- myDF$V9[grep("PURDUE", myDF$V12)]
v1 <- grep("WEST LAFAYETTE", v)
v2 <- grep("W LAFAYETTE", v)
v3 <- grep("W. LAFAYETTE", v)
length(v1) + length(v2) + length(v3)
----

c. Among the donations by people at Purdue, the campaign C00401224 (ACTBLUE) received the largest number of donations.

`tail(sort(table(myDF$V1[grep("PURDUE", myDF$V12)])))`


Question 4.

Consider (only) the residents of Lafayette and West Lafayette.  What is the size of an average donation from such people?

Solution:

We search for the cities from Indiana that contain Lafayette in the name, because this will also get cities with West Lafayette in the name too.

Then we look at all such donation amounts, and take the average.

The average size of such a donation is 121.8081 dollars.

`mean(myDF$V15[grepl("LAFAYETTE", myDF$V9) & grepl("IN", myDF$V10)])`


Question 5.

a. Which 10 professions made the largest numbers of donations?  (Do not worry about the dollar amount of the donations.)

b. Which 10 professions had the largest total dollar amount of donations?

Solution:

a. The largest number of donations were made from these 10 professions:

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15, myDF$V13, length)), 11)`

b. The largest dollar amount of donations were made from these 10 professions:

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15, myDF$V13, sum)), 11)`


Question 6.

Find the total dollar amount of contributions, grouped according to each of the following individual zip codes: 47901, 47902, 47903, 47904, 47905, 47906, 47907, 47909, 47996.  If a zip code is listed as a 9-digit zip, then you need to (first) trim it down to a 5-digit zip code.  Hint: strtrim might be helpful for this purpose.

Solution:

The total dollar amount of donations in the local zip codes are:

`tapply(myDF$V15,strtrim(myDF$V11,5),sum)[c("47901","47902","47903","47904","47905","47906","47907","47909","47996")]`

Question 7.

a. Find the top 15 cities in Indiana according to the total amount of money donated.

b. Find the top 15 cities in the USA, according to the total amount of money donated.

Solution:

a. The top 15 cities in Indiana, according to the amount donated, are

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15[myDF$V10 == "IN"],myDF$V9[myDF$V10 == "IN"],sum)),15)`

b. The top 15 cities in the whole country, according to the amount donated, are

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15,myDF$V9,sum)),15)`

Question 8.

a. On which day of the election season did Hillary Clinton receive the largest amount of money?

b. On which day of the election season did Donald Trump receive the largest amount of money?

You may use the campaign numbers from the last project, namely:

`"HILLARY FOR AMERICA"`, `C00575795`

and

`"DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC."`, `C00580100`

Solution:

a. Hillary Clinton received the largest amount of money on July 29, 2016.

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15[myDF$V1 == "C00575795"],myDF$V14[myDF$V1 == "C00575795"],sum)))`

b. Donald Trump received the largest amount of money on June 22, 2016.

`tail(sort(tapply(myDF$V15[myDF$V1 == "C00580100"],myDF$V14[myDF$V1 == "C00580100"],sum)))`

Question 9.

a.  Paste together (using the paste command) into a new vector the following information about each donor: the Name, City, State, and Zip_Code.

Then answer the following questions, using the vector from 9a to identify the donors in a (hopefully) unique way.

b.  Which donor donated the most times to Clinton's campaign?

c.  Which donor donated the most times to Trump's campaign?

d.  How many people have chosen to donate to both of the campaigns, i.e., they donated money to both Clinton and Trump?

Solution:

a. A vector of the donor information can be formed in this way:

`donorvec <- paste(myDF$V8, myDF$V9, myDF$V10, myDF$V11)`

b. The donor who donated the most times to the Clinton campaign was MITCHELL, MARCIA LOS ANGELES CA 900363146

`tail(sort(tapply( myDF$V1 == "C00575795", donorvec, sum)))`

c. The donor who donated the most times to the Trump campaign was Trump himself: TRUMP, DONALD J. NEW YORK NY 10022

`tail(sort(tapply( myDF$V1 == "C00580100", donorvec, sum)))`

d. To get the counts of the number of times that each person donated to each of the two campains (respectively), we compute these two vectors:

[source,r]
----
clintoncounts <- tapply( myDF$V1 == "C00575795", donorvec, sum )
trumpcounts <- tapply( myDF$V1 == "C00580100", donorvec, sum )
----

We can make sure that they came in the same order, by checking the lengths,

[source,r]
----
length(clintoncounts)
length(trumpcounts)
----

and moreover by checking to see that the names of the vectors agree:

`sum(names(clintoncounts) != names(trumpcounts))`

now we store the names of the donors in this order, and see which donors have a positive donation count for both:

[source,r]
----
donornames <- names(clintoncounts)
donornames[(clintoncounts > 0) & (trumpcounts > 0)]
----

There are only 3 such people.

library("ncdf4")

myfunction <- function( mystation, mylength, mymonth, myyear ) {
  
  mystring <- paste("http://amb6400b.stccmop.org:8080/thredds/dodsC/preliminary_data/", sprintf("saturn%02d", mystation),"/", sprintf("saturn%02d", mystation), ".", mylength , ".A.CT/", myyear, sprintf("%02d",mymonth), ".nc", sep="")

Question 1.

a. Create a vector corresponding to the 84 months from Nov 2009 through Oct 2016, and create a second vector containing the corresponding years.

b. Use these vectors in the context of an mapply function, to obtain the 84 months of data about the water temperature, salinity, and electrical conductivity at the SATURN03 station at the depth 2.4m. The result should be a list that contains 84 data.frames.

c. Use the sapply function to verify that all 84 data.frames have the variable names in the same order.

d. Use the do.call function to rbind these 84 data.frames into one data.frame called bigDF24. Check that the resulting data.frame has a little more than 7 million observations.

e. Repeat the steps above, to gather the data about these same 3 variables from depth 8.2m into one data.frame called bigDF82 (which will have a little less than 6 million observations).

Solution:

a. Create a vector corresponding to the 84 months from Nov 2009 through Oct 2016, and create a second vector containing the corresponding years.

[source,r]
----
mymonths <- as.integer(format(seq(as.Date("2009/11/01"), by="month", length=84), "%m"))
myyears <- as.integer(format(seq(as.Date("2009/11/01"), by="month", length=84), "%Y"))
----

b. Use these vectors in the context of an mapply function, to obtain the 84 months of data about the water temperature, salinity, and electrical conductivity at the SATURN03 station at the depth 2.4m. The result should be a list that contains 84 data.frames.

`mylist <- mapply(myfunction, 3, 240, mymonths, myyears, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)`

c. Use the sapply function to verify that all 84 data.frames have the variable names in the same order.

`sum(colnames(mylist[[1]]) != sapply(mylist, colnames))`

d. Use the do.call function to rbind these 84 data.frames into one data.frame called bigDF24. Check that the resulting data.frame has a little more than 7 million observations.

`bigDF24 <- do.call(rbind, mylist)`

e. Repeat the steps above, to gather the data about these same 3 variables from depth 8.2m into one data.frame called bigDF82 (which will have a little less than 6 million observations).

[source,r]
----
mylist <- mapply(myfunction, 3, 820, mymonths, myyears, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
sum(colnames(mylist[[1]]) != sapply(mylist, colnames))
bigDF82 <- do.call(rbind, mylist)
----


Question 2.

a. Restricting attention to the 2.4m data, what is the longest time period for which no data is available, i.e., what is the longest time period in which no data is collected?

b. On which day does that biggest gap occur?

Solution:

a. Restricting attention to the 2.4m data, what is the longest time period for which no data is available, i.e., what is the longest time period in which no data is collected?

`mymax <- which.max(diff(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time, "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", origin="1970-01-01")))`

The longest time period is 21.09657 days

`as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time, "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", origin="1970-01-01")[mymax+1] - as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time, "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", origin="1970-01-01")[mymax]`

b. This occurs from roughly Feb 4, 2014 to Feb 25, 2014. We did not take the Pacific time zone into account yet; we will do that in the code in question 3.

`as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time, "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", origin="1970-01-01")[mymax:(mymax+1)]`


Question 3.

a. Find the daily mean values for water_temperature at depth 2.4m.

b. Plot the resulting daily mean values for water_temperature at depth 2.4m.

c. Re-consider 3a and 3b for water_electrical_conductivity, and then also for water_salinity.

Solution:

a.  Find the daily mean values for water_temperature at depth 2.4m.

`meantemp <- tapply(bigDF24$water_temperature, format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m/%d"), mean)`

b.  Plot the resulting daily mean values for water_temperature at depth 2.4m.

`plot(as.Date(names(meantemp)),meantemp)`

c.  Re-consider 3a and 3b for water_electrical_conductivity, and then also for water_salinity.

[source,r]
----
meanelec <- tapply(bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity, format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m/%d"), mean)
plot(as.Date(names(meanelec)),meanelec)
----

The electrical conductivity was erroneous for much of the data in the previous plot, so we fix it here.

[source,r]
----
plot(as.Date(names(meanelec)[meanelec > -100]),meanelec[meanelec > -100])
meansal <- tapply(bigDF24$water_salinity, format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m/%d"), mean)
plot(as.Date(names(meansal)),meansal)
----


Question 4.

a. Decide what constitutes a false reading, i.e., data that is probably an outlier. What are your criteria for having a false reading?

b. How many false readings occur at depth 2.4m? Please break your responses down to a month-by-month tally, for each variable.

Solution:

ab. Decide what constitutes a false reading, i.e., data that is probably an outlier. What are your criteria for having a false reading? It looks like the temperature should always be between (roughly) 0 to 30 degrees, and there are four false readings for the water temperature.

[source,r]
----
sum( (bigDF24$water_temperature < 0) | (bigDF24$water_temperature > 30), na.rm=T )
baddates <- (bigDF24$water_temperature < 0) | (bigDF24$water_temperature > 30)

tapply(bigDF24$water_temperature[baddates], format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time[baddates]-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m"), length)
----

It initially looks like the salinity should always be between (roughly) 0 to 25, and that would imply that there are 257579 false readings for the salinity

[source,r]
----
sum( (bigDF24$water_salinity < 0) | (bigDF24$water_salinity > 25), na.rm=T )
baddates <- (bigDF24$water_salinity < 0) | (bigDF24$water_salinity > 25)

tapply(bigDF24$water_salinity[baddates], format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time[baddates]-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m"), length)
----

but then, if we consider the rest of the salinity values, they are all less than 32, so the rest of the salinity values are probably OK after all.

`summary(bigDF24$water_salinity[baddates])`

Perhaps all of the electrical conductivity values below -100 are faulty. Indeed, we can check that the electrical conductivity values should be nonnegative. Probably the values larger than 30 are erroneous.

[source,r]
----
sum( (bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity < 0) | (bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity > 30), na.rm=T )
baddates <- (bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity < 0) | (bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity > 30)

tapply(bigDF24$water_electrical_conductivity[baddates], format(as.POSIXct(bigDF24$time[baddates]-60*60*8, "%Y/%m/%d", origin="1970-01-01"), tz="PST", "%Y/%m"), length)
