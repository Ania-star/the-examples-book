    "Don't be intimidated by this project. It looks long, but often times a question part is just a small modification of the previous part. I'd highly recommend reading (or at least skimming) the resources above. They will help you get a better understanding and definitely help you with this project.\n",

    "Question 1 deals with writing a script and using `sys.argv` to handle arguments. Arguments are simply the text that occur after the command. For example, in `cp myfile.txt ~/superimportantproject/myfile2.txt`, `cp` is the command, and `myfile.txt` is the first arguments, and `~/superimportantproject/myfile2.txt` is the second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2 deals with re-working the same script in Question 1. We make it more robust and use a package called `argparse` instead of `sys.argv`. You *definitely* want to read [this](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) resource before/during solving this problem. It will provide you with everything you need to solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3 brings our `media` package back into the picture. You'll have to set up our parser using `argparse` like in question 2. After that all you have to do is use and understand functions from the up-to-date `media` package, and one function from `sklearn`. The rest is provided for you!"
