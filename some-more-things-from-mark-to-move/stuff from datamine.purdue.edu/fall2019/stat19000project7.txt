1a.  Display the stanza of poetry written in this file:
/class/datamine/data/hidden/poem.txt
Hint: The cat command should be helpful for this purpose.

1b.  Download the 2006 flights from the 2009 ASA Data Expo,
as shown in the project 7 examples:
wget http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2006.csv.bz2
bzip2 -d 2006.csv.bz2
How many flights are found in the 2006 file?
Hint 1: The wc command should be helpful for this purpose.
Hint 2: Don't forget to check the head of the file--the first line of the file is the header,
and you do not want to count that in your total.


2a.  Using the flights from 2006 that were downloaded in question 1b,
save all of the information about the flights that departed or arrived at IND,
into a new file called indyflights.csv.
Hint 1: The grep command should be helpful for this purpose.
Hint 2: The right carrot is used for saving the output into a new file.

2b.  Using the 5000_transactions.csv file from 8451,
save all of the information about the purchases from January 1, 2017 (but no other information), into a new file called newyearsday.csv.
Hint: You might want to (first) check the head of the file, so that you get the format of the dates correct.

2c.  Using the data from the 2018 election campaign donations, 
save all of the information about the donors that were somehow affiliated with Purdue,
into a new file called purduedonations.txt.
Hint:  All of the contents of the file are in capital letters, so search for PURDUE rather than Purdue.

2d.  How many such donations were made in the 2018 election campaign, from Purdue-related donors?


3.  Using the flights from 2006 that were downloaded in question 1b,
save all of the information about the origins and destinations of the flights (but none of the other information from the other variables), into a new file called originsdestinations.csv.
Hint: The cut command should be helpful for this purpose.
