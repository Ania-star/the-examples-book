<b>Academic honesty:</b> All students are expected to abide by Purdue's
<a href="http://www.purdue.edu/univregs/studentconduct/regulations.html">Student 
Conduct Code</a>.  Academic dishonesty of any type
will result in a failing "F" course grade,
as well as other consequences deemed appropriate
by the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/odos/">Office 
of the Dean of Students</a>.
Students can report issues of academic integrity that they observe,
either through the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/odos/">Office 
of the Dean of Students</a>, or by calling 765-494-8778 or email: <a href="mailto:integrity@purdue.edu">integrity@purdue.edu</a>
<br>
<br>
<b>Attendance:</b> Extensions of deadlines may be given in
only rare cases, such as:
the death of a family member; 
religious (or similar) observances; 
or mandatory attendance at an official Purdue event. 
Please contact Dr. Ward 
at least one week in advance of any planned events.
A note from a doctor, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 
or other official, will be necessary for excused absences.
Please see the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/studentregulations/regulations_procedures/classes.html">Purdue Regulations for Absences</a>.
The Provost provides these guidelines about student absences:
"The University expects that students will attend classes for which they are registered. At times, however, either anticipated or unanticipated absences can occur. The student bears the responsibility of informing the instructor in a timely fashion, when possible. The instructor bears the responsibility of trying to accommodate the student either by excusing the student or allowing the student to make up work, when possible. The University expects both students and their instructors to approach problems with class attendance in a manner that is reasonable."
<br>
<br>
<b>Academic adjustments:</b> Please refer all cases to the
<a href="http://www.purdue.edu/odos">Office of the Dean of Students</a>
in Schleman Hall.
The staff at the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/drc">Disability Resource Center</a> (YONG 830, 765-494-1247) arrange classroom accommodations for students with disabilities.

<br>
<b>Nondiscrimination:</b> Purdue University prohibits discrimination against any member of the University community on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, disability, or status as a veteran.
Dr. Ward intends for STAT 29000 to be welcoming and fair for all students.<br>

Here are some <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/EHPS">other enhancements to campus emergency notification</a><br>
<br>
On the first day of class, the following information is required to be presented to students:

As we begin this semester I want to take a few minutes and discuss emergency preparedness.  Purdue University is a very safe campus and there is a low probability that a serious incident will occur here at Purdue.  However, just as we receive a "safety briefing" each time we get on an aircraft, we want to emphasize our emergency procedures for evacuation and shelter in place incidents.  Our preparedness will be critical if an unexpected event occurs.<br>
<br>
Emergency preparedness is your personal responsibility.  Purdue University is continuously preparing for natural disasters or human-caused incidents with the ultimate goal of maintaining a safe and secure campus.  Let's review the following procedures:<br>
<ul>
<li>To report an emergency, call 911.
<li>To obtain updates regarding an ongoing emergency, and to sign up for Purdue Alert text messages, view <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/ea">http://www.purdue.edu/ea</a>
<li>There are nearly 300 Emergency Telephones outdoors across campus and in parking garages that connect directly to the Purdue Police Department (PUPD).  If you feel threatened or need help, push the button and you will be connected immediately.
<li>If we hear a <b>fire alarm</b>, we will immediately suspend class, <b>evacuate the building</b>, and proceed outdoors, and away from the building.  <b>Do not use the elevator.</b>
<li>If we are notified of a Shelter in Place requirement for a tornado warning, we will suspend class and shelter in the lowest level of this building away from windows and doors.
<li>If we are notified of a Shelter in Place requirement for a hazardous materials release, or a civil disturbance, including a shooting or other use of weapons, we will suspend class and shelter in our classroom, shutting any open doors or windows, locking or securing the door, and turning off the lights.
<li>Your course syllabus includes additional preparedness information as it might impact this class, including class suspension for severe weather or other emergencies.  Please review the syllabus and the Emergency Preparedness website for additional information.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SYLLABUS ATTACHMENT<br>
<br>
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES are based on a simple concept--if you hear a fire alarm inside, proceed outside. If you hear a siren outside, proceed inside.
<ul>
<li>Indoor Fire Alarms mean to stop class or research and immediately evacuate the building. Proceed to your Emergency Assembly Area away from building doors. Remain outside until police, fire, or other emergency response personnel provide additional guidance or tell you it is safe to leave.
<li>All Hazards Outdoor Emergency Warning Sirens mean to immediately seek shelter (Shelter in Place) in a safe location within the closest building. "Shelter in place" means seeking immediate shelter inside a building or University residence. This course of action may need to be taken during a tornado, a civil disturbance including a shooting or release of hazardous materials in the outside air. Once safely inside, find out more details about the emergency*. Remain in place until police, fire, or other emergency response personnel provide additional guidance or tell you it is safe to leave.
</ul>
*In both cases, you should seek additional clarifying information by all means possible... Purdue Home page, email alert, TV, radio, etc... review the Purdue Emergency Warning Notification System multi-communication layers at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/ehps/emergency_preparedness/warning-system.html">http://www.purdue.edu/ehps/emergency_preparedness/warning-system.html</a><br>
<br>
EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES:<br>
<ul>
<li>Review the Emergency Procedures Guidelines <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/emergency_preparedness/flipchart/index.html">https://www.purdue.edu/emergency_preparedness/flipchart/index.html</a>
<li>Review the Building Emergency Plan (available from the building deputy) for:<ul>
<li>evacuation routes, exit points, and emergency assembly area
<li>when and how to evacuate the building.
<li>shelter in place procedures and locations
<li>additional building specific procedures and requirements.
</ul>
</ul>
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AWARENESS VIDEOS<br>
<br>
"Shots Fired on Campus: When Lightning Strikes," is a 20-minute active shooter awareness video that illustrates what to look for and how to prepare and react to this type of incident.
