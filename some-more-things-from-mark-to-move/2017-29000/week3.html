<hr>
Here are links to some books:
<ul>
<li><a href="awk.html">Books about the awk tool</a>
</ul>
<br>
In particular,
it is probably helpful to read Chapter 1 and the beginning of Chapter 2 from the book AWK Programming Language by Alfred V. Aho, Brian W. Kernighan, and Peter J. Weinberger (Addison-Wesley, 1988).
