"As a boilermaker pursuing academic excellence, I pledge to be honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together - we are Purdue."<br>
<br>
<b>Academic honesty:</b> All students are expected to abide by Purdue's
<a href="http://www.purdue.edu/univregs/studentconduct/regulations.html">Student 
Conduct Code</a>.  
Incidents of academic misconduct in this course will be addressed by the course instructor and referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) for review at the university level. Any violation of course policies as it relates to academic integrity will result minimally in a failing or zero grade for that particular assignment, and at the instructor's discretion may result in a failing grade for the course. In addition, all incidents of academic misconduct will be forwarded to OSRR, where university penalties, including removal from the university, may be considered.<br>
<br>
Students can report issues of academic integrity that they observe,
either through the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/odos/">Office 
of the Dean of Students</a>, or by calling 765-494-8778 or email: <a href="mailto:integrity@purdue.edu">integrity@purdue.edu</a>.<br>
<br>
Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breeches of this value by either emailing <a href="mailto:integrity@purdue.edu">integrity@purdue.edu</a> or by calling 765-494-8778.  While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information that is submitted provides the greatest opportunity for the university to investigate the concern.<br>

<b>Attendance:</b> Extensions of deadlines may be given in only rare cases, such as: the death of a family member;  religious (or similar) observances;  or mandatory attendance at an official Purdue event. 
Please contact Dr. Ward at least one week in advance of any planned events.
A note from a doctor, or the Office of the Dean of Students, or other official, will be necessary for excused absences.
Please see the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/studentregulations/regulations_procedures/classes.html">Purdue Regulations for Absences</a>.
The Provost provides these guidelines about student absences:
"The University expects that students will attend classes for which they are registered. At times, however, either anticipated or unanticipated absences can occur. The student bears the responsibility of informing the instructor in a timely fashion, when possible. The instructor bears the responsibility of trying to accommodate the student either by excusing the student or allowing the student to make up work, when possible. The University expects both students and their instructors to approach problems with class attendance in a manner that is reasonable."<br>

Here are some <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/EHPS">other enhancements to campus emergency notification</a><br>
<br>
On the first day of class, the following information is required to be presented to students:<br>
<br>
As we begin this semester I want to take a few minutes and discuss emergency preparedness.  Purdue University is a very safe campus and there is a low probability that a serious incident will occur here at Purdue.  However, just as we receive a "safety briefing" each time we get on an aircraft, we want to emphasize our emergency procedures for evacuation and shelter in place incidents.  Our preparedness will be critical IF an unexpected event occurs!<br>
<br>
Emergency preparedness is your personal responsibility.  Purdue University is actively preparing for natural disasters or human-caused incidents with the ultimate goal of maintaining a safe and secure campus. Let's review the following procedures:<br>
<ul>
<li>For any emergency call 911.
<li>There are nearly 300 Emergency Telephone Systems throughout campus that connect directly to the Purdue Police Department (PUPD). If you feel threatened or need help, push the button and you will be connected to the PUPD.
<li>If we hear a fire alarm we will immediately evacuate the building and proceed to the Memorial Mall.
<ul>
<li>Do not use the elevator.
<li>Go over evacuation route...see specific Building Emergency Plan.
</ul>
<li>If we are notified of a Shelter in Place requirement for a tornado warning we will shelter in the lowest level of this building away from windows and doors. Our preferred location is Ground Floor.
<li>If we are notified of a Shelter in Place requirement for a hazardous materials release we will shelter in our classroom shutting any open doors and windows.
<li>If we are notified of a Shelter in Place requirement for a civil disturbance such as a shooting we will shelter in a room that is securable preferably without windows. Our preferred location is in your classroom with the door locked.
</ul>
(NOTE: Each building will have different evacuation & shelter locations. The specific Building Emergency Plan will provide specific locations and procedures)<br>
<br>
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SYLLABUS ATTACHMENT<br>
<br>
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES are based on a simple concept--if you hear a fire alarm inside, proceed outside. If you hear a siren outside, proceed inside.
<ul>
<li>Indoor Fire Alarms mean to stop class or research and immediately evacuate the building.
<ul>
<li>Proceed to your Emergency Assembly Area away from building doors. Remain outside until police, fire, or other emergency response personnel provide additional guidance or tell you it is safe to leave.
</ul>
<li>All Hazards Outdoor Emergency Warning Sirens mean to immediately seek shelter (Shelter in Place) in a safe location within the closest building.
<ul>
<li>Shelter in place means seeking immediate shelter inside a building or University residence. This course of action may need to be taken during a tornado, a civil disturbance including a shooting or release of hazardous materials in the outside air. Once safely inside, find out more details about the emergency*. Remain in place until police, fire, or other emergency response personnel provide additional guidance or tell you it is safe to leave.
</ul>
</ul>
*In both cases, you should seek additional clarifying information by all means possible... Purdue Emergency Status page, text message, Twitter, Desktop Alert, Albertus Beacon, digital signs, email alert, TV, radio, etc. ...review the Purdue Emergency Warning Notification System multi-communication layers at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/ehps/emergency_preparedness/warning-system.html">http://www.purdue.edu/ehps/emergency_preparedness/warning-system.html</a><br>
<br>
EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES:<br>
<ul>
<li>Review the Emergency Procedures Guidelines <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/emergency_preparedness/flipchart/index.html">https://www.purdue.edu/emergency_preparedness/flipchart/index.html</a>
<li>Review the Building Emergency Plan (available on the Emergency Preparedness website or from the building deputy) for:
<ul>
<li>evacuation routes, exit points, and emergency assembly area
<li>when and how to evacuate the building.
<li>shelter in place procedures and locations
<li>additional building specific procedures and requirements.
</ul>
</ul>
