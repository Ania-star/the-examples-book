# First we need to make a plain text file called .my.cnf in your home directory
# with only two lines, namely:
#     [client]
#     password="xxxxxx"
# where the xxxxxx is your password
# now we are ready to make MySQL calls directly from inside R.
#
# You should make one such file in your home directory on llc
# and another such file in your home directory on maven
# That way, you can call SQL from either location.

# The following will set up a connection

# You will need to change the username
# and the dbname to match your own username.
con <- dbConnect(m, host="mydb.ics.purdue.edu", username="mdw", dbname="mdw")

# Here is the class of the returned object.
# It is a data.frame.
