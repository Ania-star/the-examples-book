# you can see a recent history of what you have typed in bash
history

# note: it is possible to expand the length of the history,
# which is initially limited to something like 1000 lines

# "print working directory" shows where you currently are working
pwd

# cd .. takes you up to the parent of the current directory
# because the double dot (..) denotes the parent directory
cd ..

# cd without any other parameter just takes you to your home directory
cd

# ls will list the files in the current directory
ls

# ls with the options -la shows you more information,
# including the date files were modified, the permissions, etc.
# it is helpful to read about the permissions in UNIX
ls -la

# you can spawn a clock in a new X window but you can't type more until you close it
xclock

# if you want to spawn such a process and be able to keep typing, use an ampersand
xclock &

# who shows you the people who are logged onto the system
who

# date shows the current date and time
date

# cat just concatenates all of the content of a file and displays it
# (this can be messy if you file is huge)
# here we just show the contents of the password file
cat /etc/passwd

# nano is a program for creating new files
nano trythis.txt

# head shows you the first 10 lines of a file
head trythis.txt

# tail shows you the last 10 lines of a file
tail trythis.txt

# for example, here are the first ten lines of the airplane data
head /data/public/dataexpo2009/allyears.csv 

# man shows you the manual pages
# just scroll up and down to read, and type q when you want to quit
man who

# we can adjust how many lines of output we want to see in the head command
head -n3 trythis.txt

# here is the manual for the head command (again type q when you want to quit)
man head

# again, here is the password file on the machine
cat /etc/passwd

# let's look at the first field (that's the f1), using colon (:) as a delimiter
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

# we can get the same effect by piping the output of cat into the cut command
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

# we can also display the first 10 lines of the airplane data,
# and then view just the 17th field
head /data/public/dataexpo2009/allyears.csv | cut -d, -f17

# wc shows you the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file:
wc /data/public/dataexpo2009/allyears.csv 

# we extract the first several origin airport codes:
head /data/public/dataexpo2009/2008.csv | cut -d, -f17

# and then we export these to a file
head /data/public/dataexpo2009/2008.csv | cut -d, -f17 >short.txt

# now we do the same, but with all of the airport codes
cat /data/public/dataexpo2009/2008.csv | cut -d, -f17 | 

# we can sort the output and then remove the duplicates
cat /data/public/dataexpo2009/2008.csv | cut -d, -f17 | sort | uniq

# this shows us how many such airport codes there were
cat /data/public/dataexpo2009/2008.csv | cut -d, -f17 | sort | uniq | wc

# finally we are done, so we can exit
exit
