We can extract data about ATL to ORD flights.<br>
First navigate to the Data Expo 2009 directory:<br>
<tt>cd /depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009/</tt><br>
<br>
We can find all of the flights that departed from Atlanta
and arrived at O'Hare, and save them in a file:<br>
<tt>grep ATL,ORD 2005.csv >AtlantaToChicago.txt</tt><br>
<br>
There are 8324 lines in the <tt>AtlantaToChicago.txt</tt> file.<br>
We can tell this by checking the number of lines in this file,<br>
using the <tt>wc</tt> command:<br>
<tt>wc AtlantaToChicago.txt</tt><br>
<br>
This gives the number of lines, words, and characters.<br>
Since each line has no spaces, this means that it treats each line as a word,<br>
only in this case.  It is useful for other applications too.<br>
If we only want to see the number of lines, we can use the <tt>-l</tt> flag:<br>
<tt>wc -l AtlantaToChicago.txt</tt><br>
<br>
The last 10 lines that you typed are accessible from:<br>
<tt>history | tail</tt><br>
<br>
If you want to temporarily make a directory and then remove it,<br>
we can do that:<br>
<tt>mkdir tempstuff</tt><br>
<br>
and then we can see that it exists:<br>
<tt>ls</tt><br>
<br>
and then we can throw it away:<br>
<tt>rmdir tempstuff</tt><br>
<br>
Similarly, we can rename the <tt>AtlantaToChicago.txt</tt> file:<br>
<tt>mv AtlantaToChicago.txt myfile.txt</tt><br>
<br>
or even make a copy:<br>
<tt>cp myfile.txt backup.txt</tt><br>
<br>
and we can just throw one of these away:<br>
<tt>rm myfile.txt</tt><br>
<br>
but we still have the backup.  Here are its contents:<br>
<tt>cat backup.txt</tt><br>
<br>
