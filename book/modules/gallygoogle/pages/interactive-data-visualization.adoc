Step 1- We must first load in the data and clean it using Pandas 
We are going to use public data from Austraila that maps out the public toilets across the country and a checklist of the ammenities at each location. 

[source,python]
import pandas as pd
# Importing our csv into pandas
ToiletsAU = pd.read_csv("toiletmapexport_220501_074429.csv")
# Looking at the first 5 rows of our dataframe 
ToiletsAU.head()

The function 'head' looks at the first 5 rows of your data, it also allows you to see how many columns are in your dataset.
