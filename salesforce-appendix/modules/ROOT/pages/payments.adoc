== Setting up a New Payment

[NOTE]
====
Please, before setting up a new payment, it is recommended for you to (first) review the "Setting up a New Project" section and the "Setting up a New Sponsor Acknowledgment" section first, if the project or the sponsor acknowledgment has not (yet) been entered there.  That way, we can be certain to name things consistently.
