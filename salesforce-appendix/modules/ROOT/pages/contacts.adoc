== Setting up a New Contact

[NOTE]
====
Please, before setting up a new lead or a new contact, it is recommended for you to (first) review the "Setting up a New Partner" section first, if the person's company or university has not (yet) been entered there.  That way, we can be certain to name things consistently.  The name of the partner will even automatically populate for contacts (although not for leads).
