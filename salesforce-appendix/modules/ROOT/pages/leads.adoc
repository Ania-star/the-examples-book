== Setting up a New Lead

[NOTE]
====
Please, before setting up a new lead or a new contact, it is recommended for you to (first) jump down to the "Setting up a New Partner" section first, if the person's company or university has not (yet) been entered there.  That way, for instance, we can be certain to name things consistently.  The name of the partner will even automatically populate for contacts (although not for leads).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
"When updating existing accounts or contacts during lead conversion, the values of mapped lead fields donâ€™t overwrite the values of the mapped account and contact fields."

[TIP]
====
This page describes how a lead's values are converted to contacts, accounts ("partnerships" in The Data Mine language), and opportunities ("projects" in The Data Mine language):
