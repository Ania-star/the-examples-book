== Description of the Data
This dataset provides a summary of the global carbon dioxide emission. The data includes information on CO2 emissions across different industries and different sectors, as well as consumption and other greenhouse gases, with multiple metrics such as annual, cumulative, and per capita. We can gain insights into these starting from 1750 until 2023, allowing exploration of emission data over a larger timeline on top of comparisons between different countries and regions.
