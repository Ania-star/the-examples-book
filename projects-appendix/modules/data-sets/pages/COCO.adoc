= Common Objects in Context

== Source

I think that the COCO data comes from this site:
https://cocodataset.org/#download

== Description of the Data

The https://cocodataset.org/[homepage for the COCO data set] states "COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset."

== Transformations to the original data source

Kevin downloaded this data in February 2022.  Mark is unsure if there were any transformations to this data set.
