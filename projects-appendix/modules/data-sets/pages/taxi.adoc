Somewhat recently, this website changed the format of data provided.  It previously provided data in csv format but now provides data in parquet format.

== Description of the Data

The taxi data set includes data about trips on yellow taxi cabs, green taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, and high-volume for-hire vehicles.

The website provides several guides, dictionaries, maps, and lookup tables.

== Transformations to the original data source

Kevin has created several transformations of the data.

For instance, he built two databases of the taxi data.
