= Think Summer: Project 2 -- 2024

== On Monday, in Question 5, we started with Whoopi Goldberg's `person_id`.  Revisit this question WITHOUT looking up her `person_id` from the Internet, as follows:  Search in the `people` table for entries with `name` equal to `Whoopi Goldberg`.  Then `join` the `people` table to the `crew` table, to discover the same things as you did on Monday, namely:  how many times has she been a member of a `crew`?  How many times was she an actress?  A producer?  A writer?  Now pick your own favorite director, actor or actress, or writer, etc., and find how many crews include that person?  Hint:  When you choose your own favorite person, start with their name (instead of starting with their `person_id`).  Be sure to check that there is only one person with that name in the `people` table.


== Who was the Director of the movie `Say Anything...`?  Hint:  Start by finding the movie title `Say Anything...` in the `titles` table.  Then `join` the `titles` table to the `crew` table, to find out which person was the director of `Say Anything...`.  (P.S.  This is Dr Ward's all-time favorite movie.)


== Starting with only the `person_id` from Question 2, use (only one) SQL query to find their name and also the titles of all of the movies that they have directed in their career.


== Join the `titles` table and the `ratings` table, to see how many tvEpisodes have more than 200000 votes.


== How many tvEpisodes have more than 1000 votes and also have rating 8 or higher?


== For how many movies has George Clooney been on the `crew`?


== Which of George Clooney's movies are the most popular?  (By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!  Just be sure to explain what you did in your solution.)


== How many episodes of The West Wing had rating 9 or higher?


== Bonus question:  In question 4, we found the ID numbers of two episodes that had more than 200000 votes each.  It turns out that these two episodes are from the same tvSeries.  Which tvSeries was this?  To solve this question, first `join` the `episodes` table, linking your previous `title_id` values to the `episode_title_id`.  After you check that this worked, then `join` the `titles` table again (using a new nickname for the titles table, of course~), linking your `show_title_id` to the `title_id`.







== In which years did more than 300000 titles have their premieres?  Hint:  Use the `titles` table, and `GROUP BY` the year `premiered` and use the condition `HAVING COUNT(*) > 300000` at the end of the query.

== How many `tvSeries` have rating 9 or higher and have at least 1 million votes?

== For how many movies has Julia Roberts been on the `crew`?

== What are the 4 most popular episodes of the Sopranos?  Please include the title of each episode.  Please verify your answer by double-checking with IMDB.

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!  Just be sure to explain what you did in your solution.)

Hint:  When you join the `episodes` table and the `ratings` table, you might want to add the condition `e.episode_title_id = r.title_id` so that you can get the titles of the episodes.

== Revisiting the question about Meryl Streep:  What are the titles in which Meryl Streep had the role of `actress` and the rating was 8.5 or higher?

== Revisiting the question about the `tvSeries` that have rating 9 or higher and have at least 1 million votes: please find the `primary_title` of these `tvSeries`.

== Revisiting the question about how many movies has Julia Roberts been on the `crew`:  Which movie(s) is/are her most popular?

(By "popularity", you can choose to either analyze the ratings or the number of votes; either way is OK with us!  Again, just be sure to explain what you did in your solution.)
