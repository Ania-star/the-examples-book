= 301 Project 05 - Multiple Linear Regression  

== Project Objectives

In the last project, we went through the steps to build a Linear Regression model. In this project, we will build a simple Multiple Linear Regression Model.

== Dataset

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/boston.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

First, load the dataset:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
my_df = pd.read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/boston.csv")
----

Before starting to build the model, understand the dataset, you can always check if there are any missing values.

`isnull` can be used to identify missing values in the dataset. Please read https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_isnull.asp[this file] to get more information.

.. Please check how many missing values 'my_df' contains.
+
[TIP]
====
`sum` can be useful for calculation.
====

Then you can separate the data into independent variables and the dependent variable, using the following statements:

[source,python]
----
# Independent variables
X = my_df.iloc[:, :-1].values

# Dependent variable
y = my_df.iloc[:, -1].values
----

.. Please list the independent variables and what the dependent variable is from 'my_df'.

=== Question 2 (2 points)

Now let's start building the model. First split the dataset into two sets: training and testing.

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
----

.. Please visualize the whole dataset and the training set using the provided statement below.
.. Please compare if you observe anything by comparing the two plots.

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.hist(y, bins=20)
plt.title("Housing Price Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Median Values")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
----

=== Question 3 (2 points)

Next, let's scale the features.

.. Please complete the code to scale the features using StandardScaler.

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = # your code here
X_test_scaled = # your code here 
----

=== Question 4 (2 points)

Next, we will train a Multiple Linear Regression model using the training data.

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
----

The intercept is the dependent variable's value when all independent variables' values are zero. 

Coefficients reflect the change in the dependent variable  

The following code is an example to get the intercept and coefficients:

[source,python]
----
# Intercept  
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)

# Coefficients  
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
----

.. Please train the model and find out the intercept and coefficients of the model. 
.. Using your own words to explain the meaning of values of intercept and coefficients output 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

Now let us make predictions on the test set with the model.

[source,python]
----
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
----

.. Please display the predicted values as well as the actual testing values.
.. Observe the two sets; what do you find?
