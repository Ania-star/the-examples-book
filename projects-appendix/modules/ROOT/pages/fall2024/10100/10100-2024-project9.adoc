= TDM 10100: R Project 9 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Knowing how to merge data frames in R truly opens up a lot of functionality to us, and allows us to design a more comprehensive analysis of our data sets.

**Context:** The `merge` function allows us to combine information from multiple data tables.

**Scope:** merging tables

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn how to merge data frames

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv` (ice cream products)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv` (ice cream reviews)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv` (information about airports)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv` (flight data from 1990)

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Read in the ice cream `products` and `reviews` files into two separate data frames, as follows:

[source, r]
----
library(data.table)
productsDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv")
reviewsDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv")
----

Notice that these two data frames have three columns in common, namely, `brand`, `key`, and `ingredients`.  If we try to merge these two data frames by default, R will try to match data on all three columns, BUT the `ingredients` column has a different role in these two data frames.  In the `productsDF`, the `ingredients` column has a list of the ice cream ingredients.  In the `ratingsDF`, the `ingredients` column has values between 1 and 5, or an `NA` value.

For this reason, when we merge the information from the two tables, we only want to merge the data according to the `brand` and `key` values, as follows:


[source,r]
----
newmergedDF <- merge(productsDF, reviewsDF, by = c("brand", "key") )
----

Notice that the `productsDF` has 8 columns, and the `reviewsDF` has 13 columns, and the `newmergedDF` has 19 columns, namely, all of the columns from both of the previous two data frames, including two separate `ingredients` columns, one from each data frame.

In this data frame, there are 978 rows that correspond to the `name` being `"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough"`, which has `brand == "bj"` and `key == "16_bj"`.  We can get this subset of the data as follows:

[source,r]
----
ChocolateChipCookieDoughDF <- subset(newmergedDF, (brand == "bj") & (key == "16_bj"))
----

Notice that this new data frame called `ChocolateChipCookieDoughDF` has 978 rows.

What are the average number of stars for the 978 reviews in the data frame called `ChocolateChipCookieDoughDF`?


.Deliverables
====
- Print the average number of stars for the 978 reviews in the data frame called `ChocolateChipCookieDoughDF`.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Starting with the `newmergedDF`, find the average number of `stars` for the reviews of ice cream with `name == "Half Baked\302\256"`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are two characters that you will not see but they are there.  They are encoded as `"\302\256"`.
====

.Deliverables
====
- Print the average number of `stars` for the reviews of ice cream with `name == "Half Baked\302\256"`.
====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

In Project 2, we learned about the `grep` and `grepl` functions.  Using either of these two functions, you can limit attention to ice cream products that have `"Chocolate"` in the title.  (There are 50 such ice cream products.)  Find the average number of stars for all 4831 of the reviews of these products that have `"Chocolate"` in the product name.


.Deliverables
====
- Print the average number of stars for all 4831 of the reviews of these products that have `"Chocolate"` in the product name.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Read in the information about airports, and also the flight data from 1990, into two separate data frames, as follows:

[source, r]
----
library(data.table)
airportsDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/airports.csv")
flightdataDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv")
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is necessary to have 2 cores in your Jupyter Lab session for Question 4 and Question 5.
====

These two data frames do not have any columns in common!  Nonetheless, the `"iata"` values from the `airportsDF` are the three-letter codes corresponding to airports, which are also found in the `Origin` and `Dest` columns in the `flightdataDF`.  So when we merge the information from the two tables, if we want to study where the flights depart, then we only want to merge the data according to the `iata` value (from the `airportsDF`) merged with the `Origin` value (from the `flightdataDF`), as follows:


[source,r]
----
mybigDF <- merge(airportsDF, flightdataDF, by.x = "iata", by.y = "Origin")
----

Using this new data frame, find the average departure delay for all flights that have `Origin` airport in Indiana.


.Deliverables
====
- Print the average departure delay for all flights that have `Origin` airport in Indiana.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Using the same data frame from Question 4, find the average departure delay for all flights that have `Origin` airport in Houston, Texas.

.Deliverables
====
- Print the average departure delay for all flights that have `Origin` airport in Houston, Texas.

== Submitting your Work

Now you are familiar with the method of merging data from multiple data frames.


.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project9.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
