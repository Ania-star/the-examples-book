= TDM 10100: R Project 3 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Now that we are comfortable with the `table` command in R, we can learn about the `tapply` command.  The `tapply` will apply a function to values in one column, which are grouped according to another column.  This sounds abstract, but once you see some examples, it makes a lot of sense.

**Context:** `tapply` takes two columns and a function.  It applies the function to the first column of values, split into groups according to the second column.

**Scope:** `tapply` in R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learning about how to apply functions to data in groups

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
As before, please use the `seminar-r` kernel (not the `seminar` kernel).  You do not need to use the `%%R` cell magic.
====

Three examples of the `tapply` function:

Example 1, using the 1980 election data, we can find the amount of money donated in each state.

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt", quote="")
names(myDF) <- c("CMTE_ID", "AMNDT_IND", "RPT_TP", "TRANSACTION_PGI", "IMAGE_NUM", "TRANSACTION_TP", "ENTITY_TP", "NAME", "CITY", "STATE", "ZIP_CODE", "EMPLOYER", "OCCUPATION", "TRANSACTION_DT", "TRANSACTION_AMT", "OTHER_ID", "TRAN_ID", "FILE_NUM", "MEMO_CD", "MEMO_TEXT", "SUB_ID")
----

We take the money for the donations (in the `TRANSACTION_AMT` column), group the data according to the state (in the `STATE` column), and sum up the donation amounts:

`tapply(myDF$TRANSACTION_AMT, myDF$STATE, sum)`

Example 2, using the ice cream products data, we can find the average rating for each brand.

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv")
----

We take the rating (in the `rating` column), group the data according to the brand (in the `brand` column), and take an average of these reviews:

`tapply(myDF$rating, myDF$brand, mean)`

Example 3, using the 1990 airport data, we can find the average departure delay for flights from each airport.

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv")
----

We take the departure delays (in the `DepDelay` column), group the data according to airport where the flights depart (in the `Origin` column), and take an average of these departure delays:

`tapply(myDF$DepDelay, myDF$Origin, mean)`

The values show up as "NA" (not available) because some values are missing, so R cannot take an average.  In such a case, we can give R the fourth parameter `na.rm=TRUE` so that it ignores missing values, and we try again:

`tapply(myDF$DepDelay, myDF$Origin, mean, na.rm=TRUE)`

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Using the 1990 airport data, find the average arrival delay for flights arriving to each airport.

[HINT]
====
The arrival delays are in the `ArrDelay` column, and the planes arrive at the airports in the `Dest` (destination) column.
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)

In the grocery store file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv`

Find the sum of the amount spent (in the `SPEND` column) at each of the store regions (the `STORE_R` column).


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

In the grocery store file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv`

Find the amount of money spent in 2016 altogether, and the amount of money spent in 2017 altogether.  (You can use the `tapply` to do this with just one cell.)


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

In the Olympics file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

Find the average height of the athletes in each country (the country is the `NOC` column).

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

In the Olympics file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

Find the average height of the athletes in each sport (the sport is the `Sport` column, of course!).  Sort your results.  In which sport are the atheletes the tallest (on average)?  Does this make sense intuitively, i.e., is height an advantage in this sport?





== Submitting your Work

We only learned about `tapply` in this project because it is a short week, but it is powerful!  As always, please ask any questions you have, on Piazza, or in office hours. We hope you have a nice Labor Day weekend!

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project3.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
