= TDM 10100: R Project 13 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Up until the previous project, we've been hyperfocused on numbers and letters; we've learned how to handle, transform, store, and reformat data to do whatever we need. However, as important as data is, most people don't enjoy staring at spreadsheets and attempting to parse out patterns and meaning. That is why **visualization** is such a key aspect of data analysis. This project will cap our exploration of `ggplot2` by exploring new types of visuals and providing some more open-ended questions for you to test your creative and data science skills learned throughout the semester.

**Context:** A working understanding of piping, `dplyr`, and common `tidyverse` utilities will be helpful for this project. A strong understanding of the typical structure of a call to `ggplot2` will also be good for this project.

**Scope:** Data visualization, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn about different types of `ggplot2` visuals
- Create visuals of different types based on problem goals
- Answer open-ended questions with visuals and analysis of your own design
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/*`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Load the data, plot two simple, specific visuals, and discuss some common use cases for visuals. Try and give students an idea of when certain types of plots are appropriate to use.

.Deliverables
====
- Ipsum lorem
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Plot a more complex, specific visual 

.Deliverables
====
- Ipsum lorem
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Merge data with different countries, ask for a specific, complex visual. Likely building on previous topics

.Deliverables
====
- Ipsum lorem
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Beginning of open-ended questions. Give loose guidelines.

.Deliverables
====
- Ipsum lorem
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Repeat of question 4, but with a different plot type (of students choice). Maybe an additional requirement to make things more difficult.

== Submitting your Work

This is where we're going to say how to submit your work. Probably a bit of copypasta.

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project13.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
