= TDM 10100: R Project 13 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Up until the previous project, we've been hyperfocused on numbers and letters; we've learned how to handle, transform, store, and reformat data to do whatever we need. However, as important as data is, most people don't enjoy staring at spreadsheets and attempting to parse out patterns and meaning. That is why **visualization** is such a key aspect of data analysis. This project will cap our exploration of `ggplot2` by exploring new types of visuals and providing some more open-ended questions for you to test your creative and data science skills learned throughout the semester.

**Context:** A working understanding of piping, `dplyr`, and common `tidyverse` utilities will be helpful for this project. A strong understanding of the typical structure of a call to `ggplot2` will also be good for this project.

**Scope:** Data visualization, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn about different types of `ggplot2` visuals
- Create visuals of different types based on problem goals
- Answer open-ended questions with visuals and analysis of your own design
****

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/*`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

[IMPORTANT]
====
While this is the last _content-based_ project, you will have one more graded project that is dedicated to providing feedback and advice on how to improve the course. It should be relatively quick and easy to complete, so I would recommend taking some time to be sure you get that easy 100%!
====

To cap off this semester's content, we will be learning about some interesting and unique types of visuals included in `ggplot2` and their use cases along with providing a few open-ended questions that provide you the opportunity to showcase the skills you've been developing all semester!

To start, read the data from `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/*` into a new data structure called `USvids`. We will be working with the YouTube data again this project, both because you should already be roughly familiar with it and because you will be able to contrast your work now against that of the last project's and decide which plot types you like best.

`ggplot2` comes with a huge variety of plot types to choose from, with each having its own specific use cases based on functional benefits along with providing aesthetic choices between similar plot types for added customization.

One great example of this is the **histogram**, which is one of the most common types of plots used to look at the distribution of data. Take a look at the below example, where we use a histogram to display the distribution of likes on videos in `USvids`.

[source, r]
----
# specify data to plot
ggplot(USvids, aes(y=likes)) + 
    # create histogram with 30 bins
    geom_histogram(bins=30) + 
    ggtitle("Video Like Distribution") + 
    xlab("Video Likes") + 
    ylab("Count")
----

As you can see from the above example, our distribution is _extremely_ right-tailed, with a super high frequency centered around 0 video likes. Because this obscures many of the smaller distribution patterns in the data, we may want to try and focus on important parts of the data or scale our graph in some way.

For example, we could filter our existing data and then create a histogram of likes only within the first and third quartile of our data, like so:

[source, r]
----
# filter data between Q1 and Q3
filtered_USvids <- filter(USvids, 
                          likes >= quantile(USvids$likes)["25%"],
                          likes <= quantile(USvids$likes)["75%"])

# specify data to plot
ggplot(filtered_USvids, aes(likes)) + 
    # create histogram with 30 bins
    geom_histogram(bins=50) + 
    ggtitle("Video Like Distribution; Q1-Q3") + 
    xlab("Video Likes") + 
    ylab("Count")
----

For this question, do the following:

- Create a histogram of `comment_count` in `USvids`
- Create a histogram of `comment_count` in `USvids`, filtered for data only between the first and third quartile
- In a markdown cell, compare the two distributions. How are they similar, how are they different, and why?

[IMPORTANT]
====
As always, remember to properly style and label _all_ plots that you submit for full credit.

.Deliverables
====
- Histogram of `comment_count`
- Histogram of `comment_count` within the IQR for `comment_count`
- 2-4 sentences comparing your two distributions and positing reasons for any similarities or differences between the two

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Histograms can be useful for looking purely at the distribution of values in data, but oftentimes we want to make more complex comparisons over time to identify trends.

A great and very useful way to do this is to combine the `lubridate` functions we learned about in a previous project with `ggplot2`'s `geom_line()` plot type. 

Take a look at the below example, where we make a line plot of likes over time. Run the code, and examine the resulting visual.

[source, r]
----
ggplot(USvids, aes(x=publish_time)) +
    geom_line(aes(y=likes)) + 
    labs(title="a",
         subtitle="b",
         caption="c",
         y="Like Count")
----

As you can see, the default behavior of plotting all of our time along the same axis seems to obscure any trends, as the massive amount of likes in later years completely outweigh any of the earlier years. There are plenty of ways we could handle this, with one of which being instead plotting the _average_ amount of likes for each period of time. For example, the below code will plot the average amount of likes on a video published in a given month and year.

== Submitting your Work

This is where we're going to say how to submit your work. Probably a bit of copypasta.

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project13.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
