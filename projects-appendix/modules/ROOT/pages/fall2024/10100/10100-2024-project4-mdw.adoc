= TDM 10100: R Project 4 -- 2024

**Motivation:** We continue to practice using the `tapply` function.

**Context:** `tapply` takes two columns and a function.  It applies the function to the first column of values, split into groups according to the second column.

**Scope:** `tapply` in R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learning about how to apply functions to data in groups
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/products.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

== Questions

[IMPORTANT]
====
As before, please use the `seminar-r` kernel (not the `seminar` kernel).  You do not need to use the `%%R` cell magic.
====

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Revisit the video at the very *beginning* of Project 3, Example 1, in which we found the amount of money donated in each state, during the 1980 federal election cycle.

This time, instead of finding the amount of money donated in each state in 1980, please find the amount of money donated in each city-and-state pair.

To accomplish this, paste the city and state together like this:

`paste(myDF$CITY, myDF$STATE, sep=", ")`

We use a comma and a space for the separator in the paste function.  Take the paste and use it as the *second* element in Project 3, Example 1, so that we group the data according to the `CITY` and the `STATE`.  The goal is to show the top 20 city-and-state pairs, according to the amount of money donated.

[HINT]
====
Your answer will need to use the `sort` function and the tail function, like this:

`sort(tail(tapply( ... ), n=20))
====


[HINT]
====
Here are the top 6 city-and-state pairs (notice that the top result has a blank city-and-state pair, namely, many of the donations have a blank city-and-state):

WASHINGTON, DC

LOS ANGELES, CA

HOUSTON, TX
    7606806
NEW YORK, NY
    11345027
,
    17299729
----

In your solution, you need to show the top 20 of the top city-and-state pairs.
====

.Deliverables
====
- Show the top 20 city-and-state pairs, according to the amount of money donated.
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Revisit the video at the very *beginning* of Project 3, Example 3, in which we studied the depature delays (`DepDelay`) in the 1990 flight data:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv`

This time, instead of finding the average departure delays according to where the flights depart (in the `Origin` column), please find average departure delays on each Month / DayofMonth / Year triple

To accomplish this, paste these three columns together like this:

`paste(myDF$Month, myDF$DayofMonth, myDF$Year, sep="/")`

We use a slash for the separator in the paste function.  Take the paste and use it as the *second* element in Project 3, Example 3, so that we group the data according to the Month / DayofMonth / Year triple.  The goal is to show the worst 6 dates from 1990, according to the largest average departure delay (`DepDelay`) values.

[HINT]
====
Your answer will need to use the `sort` function and the tail function, like this:

`sort(tail(tapply( ..., ..., mean, na.rm=TRUE)))
====


[HINT]
====
Here are the worst two dates from 1990, according to the largest average departure delay (`DepDelay`) values.

[source, bash]
----
12/22/1990
    45.2222488995598
12/21/1990
    45.6617816091954
----

In your solution, you need to show the worst 6 dates from 1990, according to the largest average departure delay (`DepDelay`) values.
====

.Deliverables
====
- Show the worst 6 dates from 1990, according to the largest average departure delay (`DepDelay`) values.
====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

In the grocery store file (same file from question 2):

Find the total amount of money spent in 2016 altogether, and the total amount of money spent in 2017 altogether.  (You can use the `tapply` to do this with just one cell.)


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

In the Olympics file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

Find the average height of the athletes in each country (the country is the `NOC` column).

[TIP]
====
Remember to use `na.rm=TRUE` because some of the athelete heights are missing.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

In the Olympics file (same file from question 4):

Find the average height of the athletes in each sport (the sport is the `Sport` column, of course!).  After finding these average heights, please sort your results.  In which sport are the athletes the tallest (on average)?  Does this make sense intuitively, i.e., is height an advantage in this sport?

[TIP]
====
Again, remember to use `na.rm=TRUE` because some of the athelete heights are missing.
====


== Submitting your Work

We only learned about `tapply` in this project because it is a short week, but it is powerful!  As always, please ask any questions you have, on Piazza, or in office hours. We hope you have a nice Labor Day weekend!

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project3.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
