= TDM 10100: R Project 12 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Up to this point, we've been hyperfocused on numbers and letters; we've learned how to handle, transform, store, and reformat data to do whatever we need. However, as important as data is, most people don't enjoy staring at spreadsheets and attempting to parse out patterns and meaning. That is why **visualization** is such a key aspect of data analysis. This project will be focused on using `ggplot2` to create clear plots of data trends, and prepare us for the more complex topics that we'll broach in project 13.

**Context:** A working understanding of piping, `dplyr`, and common `tidyverse` utilities will be helpful for this project.

**Scope:** Data visualization, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, R

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn the basic structure of a `ggplot()`
- Create your first plot using `ggplot()`
- Learn about boxplots in `ggplot()`
- Explore common techniques for reformatting figures (i.e. axis scaling, faceting, etc.)
****

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

As a first step, let's talk about the general structure when using `ggplot2`. You can think of a plot created with `ggplot()` as a series of layers that we add that determine the structure, style, and type of plot. For an example structure, along with a more generic version, see below:

[source, R]
----
# working example using real data
library(tidyverse)
a <- read_csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/USvideos.csv")

# specify data to plot, with color coming from comment_count
ggplot(a, aes(x=views, y=comment_count, col=comment_count)) + 
    # create scatterplot
    geom_point() + 
    # add color scaling based on comment count
    scale_color_gradient2(low="yellow", mid="red", high="purple") + 
    ggtitle("Demonstration Plot")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# generic example using placeholder names
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("/path/to/data.csv")

# specify data to plot
ggplot(df, aes(x=column1, y=column2)) + 
    # create scatterplot
    geom_point() + 
    # set x, y axis labels and Plot Title
    xlab("Column1 Data")
    ylab("Column2 Data")
    ggtitle("Fake Plot")
----

====

Try removing specific lines from the working example provided above, swapping around the order of certain lines, or adding your own lines after reading through the linked documentation and see what happens! As I've noted before, experimentation is a _huge_ part of working with code, so don't be afraid to experiment, break things, kill your kernel and more! It's all steps towards a well-made end product.

For this question, first read the data from `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/USvideos.csv` into a data structure called `US_vids`, and then use `ggplot2` to create a scatterplot of `likes` versus `comment_count` for the US videos data. You don't have to worry about specifying a color of any type, but you should be sure that your plot has appropriate axes and plot titles (Hint: Look at the above example!).

.Deliverables
====
- A new data structure called `US_vids`
- A scatterplot of `likes` vs. `comment_count` for the `US_vids` data
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Scatter plots are a great starting point for visualizing data, but oftentimes we are interested in visuals that provide us with some more immediate and obvious statistical data. For this purpose we have the _box plot_! If you aren't already familiar with box plots, feel free to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot[take a look here] to learn more!

`ggplot2` provides us with a function specifically for creating box plots: `geom_boxplot()`. Using the same general structure as we used in the last problem, construct a boxplot of the `comment_count` data from `US_vids`. It may look a bit nonsensical, but don't worry as we'll handle that in a second.

[NOTE]
====
We aren't asking you to make any separations on the X-axis on this problem, so you only have to specify the _y_ variable in your call to `ggplot()`.
====

As you can now see, the boxplot we've created is not very useful. This is because, rather predictably, a combination of the large majority of our data being very close to 0 and our data having a large range obscures any information we can glean from the plot.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will likely see a warning messgae about `transformation introduced infinite values` when you attempt axis scaling in this next part of the question. This is a result of `0` values in our data, as `log10(0)` is undefined. This means that `0` values will be discluded from our scaled plot; not a dealbreaker, but certainly something to keep in mind going forward.
====

How can we fix this? _Axis scaling_! By default our plot's axes are scaled _linearly_, but oftentimes linear views of data can be rather useless. Luckily, `ggplot2` provides us with plenty of functions to easily change the scaling of our axes. Take a look at https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html[this docs page] detailing how to scale axes with `ggplot2()` (You can scroll down to the bottom to view examples). Using either `scale_y_continuous()` or one of its variants (i.e. `scale_log10()`), create a new boxplot where its a bit easier to discern the median and quartiles of the data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Going forward, we may always include reminders to title your plot and axes appropriately. Remember that any plots included in your project should always have appropriate titles and, when necessary, a well-formatted legend. Plot formatting is a skill, and practicing it throughout these projects will help you hone it well.

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Build on box-and-whisker of likes or comments by splitting based on category_id

Already we have a much more useful version of our plot than we originally did, simply by introducing axis scaling. However, _comparison_ is always our friend in data science and we have yet to do any!

In this question, we want you to build on the boxplot you created in the last problem, this time providing a data source for the x axis to use. In project 6, questions 1-2, you were asked to write some code to introduce a new column, `category`, into your data based on the existing `category_id` column. Copy/paste that code in so that you create an equivalent column in this project. Then create a new figure using `ggplot()` that consists of a series of boxplots separeted by `category`.

[NOTE]
====
If you're having trouble getting your X axis labels to be readable and non-overlapping, try taking a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42599953/ggplot-with-overlapping-x-axis-label[this] helpful stackoverflow post.
====

Finally, in a markdown cell, identify which category had the highest interquartile range (the "largest box") and which category had the highest maximum value for comment count.

.Deliverables
====
- Boxplots of `comment_count` separated by `category`
- A sentence detailing which category had the highest interquartile range which category had the highest max comment count
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

We've got a good compairison between categories for U.S. YouTube videos now, and some ideas about what types of videos people comment on most in the U.S.. Do you think that trend holds internationally? Luckily, its now within our power to find out!

Start by reading the data from `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/youtube/DEvideos.csv` into a new data structure called `DE_vids`. Modify the `category_id` mapping code you referenced in the last question to again map category IDs to names in your new dataset. You may assume that the `category_id` to `category` mapping is the same for both US and DE (so you can re-use the same list).

Next, run your boxplot-by-category code using the DE data instead of the US data. Are the distributions similar to those of the U.S. data?

In a markdown cell, list which category in the DE data had the largest interquartile range and which had the highest maximum value. Also note if either of these categories is different from those in the US.

Finally, add a few sentences describing any major differences you see between the two distributions. Note outliers, interesting patterns, or large deviations you find between the two of them. Well-written responses with at least 2 sentences will be accepted.

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

The comparison we just made was already a huge step forward in our data analysis, but it sure is inconvenient to have to scroll up and down between the two plots like that. Luckily, `faceting` exists to help us put our different plots all on the same figure! 

As a basic example, here is how one could create a faceted boxplot by category. Compare this to question 3, where we just stuffed the categories onto the same axis. There are a lot of benefits to this approach! Try running it yourself to see how it works.

[source, r]
----
# filter just for 3-4 categories, for easy comparison
categories <- c("News and Politics", "Education", "Comedy", "Gaming")
filtered_vids <- filter(US_vids, category %in% categories)

# create faceted boxplot
ggplot(filtered_vids, aes(y=comment_count)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") +
    facet_wrap(~ category, scales = 'free')
----

For a more complex look, take a glance at the below example, where I've used faceting to compare side-by-side the "Comedy" categories for the US and DE. For more information, take a look at [this docs page] or https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57457872/how-to-use-ggplot-faceting-with-data-from-different-dataframes[this stackoverflow post], or https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32747808/facets-and-multiple-datasets-in-ggplot2[this one].

[source, r]
----
# add a country identifier column to each dataset
US_vids$country <- 'US'
DE_vids$country <- 'DE'

# merge our US and DE datasets
US_DE_vids <- bind_rows(US_vids, DE_vids)

# filter for just comedy videos
US_DE_comedy <- filter(US_DE_vids, category == "Comedy")

# use faceting to plot, separating different countries
ggplot(US_DE_comedy, aes(x = category, y = comment_count)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  facet_wrap(~ country, scales = 'free') +
  labs(title = 'Faceted Box Plots', x = 'Category', y = 'Comment Count') +
  theme_minimal()
----

To complete this question, choose at least one country other than US or DE from the below list, choose any category of video, and create a faceted boxplot figure with one boxplot for each country. The actual boxplot data can be anything you want, whether that's `comment_count`, `views` or something else.

[NOTE]
====
If you're struggling with this question, take a look at the provided example where the 'US' and 'DE' comedy categories are compared. Your work should follow a very similar logic to this and in fact you can almost entirely complete this question using copy and paste from the example alone!
====

Then, in a markdown cell, write 3-4 sentences about observations you can make from your faceted plot. Compare and contrast the distributions between the different countries, and feel free to suggest some potential driving factors for the differences between each country.

.Deliverables
====
- A faceted boxplot figure comparing at least 3 different countries in some way
- 3-4 sentences of analysis on the differences between countries' distributions
====

== Submitting your Work

With that, you have now completed our first project on data visualization in R! Hopefully, you can now see the utility of `ggplot2`, and how the structure of a `ggplot()` call makes it very easy to swap out different components of a plot or adjust layout without breaking the whole thing.

In the next project, we'll go further in depth to the different types of plots available to you in `ggplot2`, and give you some freedom to explore and experiment with all the tools you've used throughout the semester.

You're almost done with the class, and it has been an absolute privilege to get to work with you all this year. Please reach out if you need anything, and I look forward to seeing you next week!
