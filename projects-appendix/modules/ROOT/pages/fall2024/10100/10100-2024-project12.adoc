= TDM 10100: R Project 12 -- 2024

**Motivation:**  Some files are too big to read into R.  We practice methods for extracting the portions of a file that we need.

**Context:**  The `fread` function allows us to read a portion of a file (either a small number of rows, and/or a small number of columns).

**Scope:**  We learn how to work with enormous files in R, if we only need a portion of the file in our analysis.

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn how to apply functions to large data sets and extract information.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales.csv` (Iowa liquor sales)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont2020.txt` (2020 election data)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb2024/basics.tsv` (Internet Movie DataBase (IMDB))

== Questions

[WARNING]
====
Please use 2 cores in your Jupyter Lab session for this project.
====

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

First load:  `library(data.table)` so that you have the `fread` function available, and also `options(repr.matrix.max.cols=50)` so that you can see 50 columns.

If you try to read the entire file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales.csv` then the `seminar-r` kernel will crash.

Instead, use `fread` with the option `nrows=1000` so that you can see (only) the first 1000 rows of the data frame.

a.  Which columns contain the `Store Number`, `Store Name`, `Address`, `City`, and `Zip Code`?

b.  Use the `select` option in `fread` to read the entire data set, but *only* those 5 columns of the data.  What is the dimension of the data set?  (Hint: it should now be 5 columns and more than 27 million rows.)

.Deliverables
====
- Which columns contain the `Store Number`, `Store Name`, `Address`, `City`, and `Zip Code`?
- What is the dimension of the data set?
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Now let's find the most popular 10 stores in two different ways:

a.  Use the `table` command to find the 10 most popular values of the `"Store Number"`

b.  Use the `table` command to find the 10 most popular values of the `"Store Name"`

c.  Use the `table` command to find the 10 most popular values of these three columns pasted together: `Address`, `City`, `"Zip Code"`

d.  Do your answers to parts (a) and (b) seem to agree?  Do your answers to parts (a) and (c) seem to agree?


.Deliverables
====
- a.  A table with the 10 most popular values of the `"Store Number"` and the number of occurrences of each.
- b.  A table with the 10 most popular values of the `"Store Name"` and the number of occurrences of each.
- c.  A table with the 10 most popular values of these three columns pasted together: `Address`, `City`, `"Zip Code"` and the number of occurrences of each.
- d.  Do your answers to parts (a) and (b) seem to agree?  Do your answers to parts (a) and (c) seem to agree?

====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

For this question, use `fread` to read in the data set again, but this time, only read in the columns `"Zip Code"`, `"Category Name"`, `"Sale (Dollars)"`.

a. Use the tapply function to sum the values of `"Sale (Dollars)"` according to the `"Zip Code"`.  Find the 10 `"Zip Code"` values that have the largest sum of `"Sale (Dollars)"` altogether, and give those `"Zip Code"` values and each of their sums of `"Sale (Dollars)"`.


b. Now use the tapply function to sum the values of `"Sale (Dollars)"` according to the `"Category Name"`.  Find the 10 `"Category Name"` values that have the largest sum of `"Sale (Dollars)"` altogether, and give those `"Category Name"` values and each of their sums of `"Sale (Dollars)"`.


.Deliverables
====
- Find the 10 `"Zip Code"` values that have the largest sum of `"Sale (Dollars)"` altogether, and give those `"Zip Code"` values and each of their sums of `"Sale (Dollars)"`.
- Find the 10 `"Category Name"` values that have the largest sum of `"Sale (Dollars)"` altogether, and give those `"Category Name"` values and each of their sums of `"Sale (Dollars)"`.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Use `fread` to read only the 10th and 15th fields of this huge file:  `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont2020.txt` (do not worry about the warning in a pink box that appears).

Sum the amount of the donations (from the 15th field) according to the state (from the 10th field).  List the top 10 states according to the sum of the donation amounts, and the sum of the donation amounts in each of these top 10 states.


.Deliverables
====
- List the top 10 states according to the sum of the donation amounts, and the sum of the donation amounts in each of these top 10 states.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Read the first 10 lines of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/imdb2024/basics.tsv` and notice that the entries of the `genres` column are strings with several types of genres, separated by commas.  On the `genres` column (for only these 10 lines), run the following:

`myDF$genres`

`strsplit(myDF$genres, ',')`

`unlist(strsplit(myDF$genres, ','))`

`table(unlist(strsplit(myDF$genres, ',')))`

Notice that, in this way, using the `strsplit` function, we can find out how many times each of the individual `genres` occur.

Now read in *only* the `genres` column of the entire file (do not worry about the warning that results).  For each of the `genres`, list how many times it occurs.  For instance, `Action` occurs 462531 times.

.Deliverables
====
- For each of the `genres`, list how many times it occurs.

== Submitting your Work

This project enables students to select the relevant columns of a data frame for their analysis.


.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project12.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
