= 201 Project 03 - Data Cleaning

In this project, we will go through some skills to clean the data, and visualize the data to better understand its structure.

== Objectives

* Visualize the data to better understand its structure and trends
* Handle duplicate records in the dataset
* Normalize and scale the data
* Combine datasets for comprehensive analysis

== Dataset

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/wine+quality/winequality-red.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/wine+quality/winequality-white.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (1 point)

[NOTE]
====
We will use Python's pandas library to load our file data in like so:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
red_wine_file_path = '/anvil/scratch/x-nzhou1/wine+quality/winequality-red.csv'
white_wine_file_path = '/anvil/scratch/x-nzhou1/wine+quality/winequality-white.csv'

red_wine_df = pd.read_csv(red_wine_file_path, delimiter=';')
white_wine_df = pd.read_csv(white_wine_file_path, delimiter=';')
----
====

.. Please display the first few rows of both datasets using `.head()`
.. Please use `describe()` to show the summary statistics for both datasets

=== Question 2 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
`duplicated` can be used to find duplicate records:

[source,python]
----
red_wine_df.duplicated()
----
====

.. Please find out how many duplicated records are in the `red_wine_df` and `white_wine_df`.

[TIP]
====
`sum` is useful to get a summary.
====

[NOTE]
====
`drop_duplicates` can be used to drop the duplicate records:

[source,python]
----
red_wine_df = red_wine_df.drop_duplicates()
white_wine_df = white_wine_df.drop_duplicates()
----
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Please check both `red_wine_df` and `white_wine_df` datasets' `shape` after dropping duplicates.

[NOTE]
====
You can use Matplotlib to create boxplots for a specific feature . 

For example, the following code for the 'alcohol' feature:

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot boxplot for the 'alcohol' feature in the red wine dataset
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.boxplot(red_wine_df['alcohol'])
plt.title('Alcohol in Red Wine')
plt.xlabel('Feature')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.show()
 
----
====

.. Please use Matplotlib to create a boxplot for Alcohol in white wine dataset


=== Question 4 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
Scaling of the data helps in standardizing the feature values. For example:

[source,python]
----
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Standardize the red wine dataset
scaler = StandardScaler()
red_wine_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(red_wine_df), columns=red_wine_df.columns)

# Standardize the white wine dataset
white_wine_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(white_wine_df), columns=white_wine_df.columns)
----
====

.. Please explain what is scaler in the example code and what are difference between original and standardized red wine dataset

=== Question 5 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
Combining datasets can potentially create more robust modeling. 

`concat` can be used to combine DataFrames. For example, the following statement combines `red_wine_df` and `white_wine_df`, but you will need to add a new column to differentiate between red and white wines before combination.

[source,python]
----
# Add a 'type' column
red_wine_df['type'] = 'red'
white_wine_df['type'] = 'white'

# Combine both datasets
wine_combined = pd.concat([red_wine_df, white_wine_df], ignore_index=True)

# Display the first few rows of the combined dataset
print(wine_combined.head())
----
====

.. Please add a column named 'type' to both `red_wine_df` and `white_wine_df`, then use `concat` to combine the two DataFrames together.
