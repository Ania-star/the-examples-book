= 201 Project 06 - Simple Analytics Visualizations

In this project, you will create simple visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

== Project Objectives

* Visualize data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* Understand basic data trends.

== Dataset

* `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/Iris.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

As always, first, let's load the dataset using pandas.

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

my_df = pd.read_csv('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/Iris.csv')
----

We will use `matplotlib` to visualize data.

Please read https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp[Python Matplotlib] introduction.

The following is an example to visualize the frequency of `SepalLengthCm` field.

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.hist(my_df['SepalLengthCm'], bins=30)
plt.title("Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Sepal length in CM")
plt.ylabel('frequency')
plt.show()
----

.. Please use your own words to explain what the distribution of each feature is in the dataset.

.. Very similar to the example, please create histograms for sepal width (`SepalWidthCm` column) to visualize its distribution.

=== Question 2 (2 points)

`Seaborn` is a Python library built on top of `Matplotlib` used for data visualization.

Please read https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_random_seaborn.asp[Seaborn Module].

The following is an example to visualize the Sepal length distribution using both `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

You need to import the `seaborn` library to use it.

[source,python]
----
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
sns.histplot(my_df['SepalLengthCm'], bins=30)
plt.title("Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Sepal length in CM")
plt.ylabel('frequency')
plt.show()
----

.. Please run the example code above and compare it with the plot from Question 1. What is your finding?

.. Very similar to the example code in the question, please use both `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create histograms for petal width (`PetalWidthCm` column) to visualize its distribution.
 

=== Question 3 (2 points)

The pairplot can be used to find out how the features are correlated with each other.

The following is an example to create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between SepalLengthCm and SepalWidthCm.

[source,python]
----
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.pairplot(my_df, vars=['SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm'], hue='Species')
plt.show()
----

.. Similar to the example, please create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm.

=== Question 4 (2 points)

We can use boxplot to compare the sepal length  across different species.

[source,python]
----
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
sns.boxplot(x='Species', y='SepalLengthCm', data=my_df)
plt.title('Sepal Length by Species')
plt.show()
----

.. Similar to the example, please create a boxplot to compare the sepal width across different species.

=== Question 5 (2 points)

Scatter plots can help us understand the relationship between two features.

The following is an example to create scatter plots for sepal length versus sepal width

[source,python]
----
sns.lmplot(x='SepalLengthCm', y='SepalWidthCm', hue='Species', data=my_df)
plt.title('Sepal Length vs Sepal Width by Species')
plt.show()
----

.. Similar to the example, please create scatter plots for petal length versus petal width and try to explain the relationship between these two features.
