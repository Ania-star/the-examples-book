= 201 Project 04: Handling Outliers and Missing Values

In this project, we will understand the concept of how to identify and handle outliers and missing values in a dataset to ensure data quality and improve the performance of subsequent data analysis or machine learning models.

== Objectives

* Identify and handle outliers in a dataset
* Impute missing values in a dataset

[NOTE]
====
Outliers are values that significantly different from other the value of observations. Outliers can lead to inaccurate results. There usually have two Common methods for detecting outliers:  Z-score method and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Imputation is to replace missing data with some other values, like `mean`, `median`, and `mode` etc.

We will use some example to demo the concepts as following

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

example_outliers = {
    'Index': range(1, 11),
    'Value': [10, 12, 11, 13, 100, 12, 11, 10, 12, 110]
}

my_df = pd.DataFrame(example_outliers).to_csv('outliers.csv', index=False)
----

[source,python]
----
example_missing = {
    'Index': range(1, 11),
    'Value': [10, 12, 11, None, 13, 12, None, 10, 12, 11]
}

my_df_2 = pd.DataFrame(example_missing)
my_df_2.to_csv('missing.csv', index=False)
----



We can use `Z-score` as a statistical measurement to the mean of a group of values. `Z-score` describes the relation to the mean values. It is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. The following is the meaning of `Z-score` values
. 0: a value is same as mean score,
. 1: a value that is one standard deviation from the mean.

Example to use Z-score:
[source,python]
----
from scipy import stats

z_scores = stats.zscore(my_df['Value'])
abs_z_scores = np.abs(z_scores)
outliers = my_df[abs_z_scores > 3]
print("Outliers detected:\n", outliers)
----

Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:

[source,python]
----
Q1 = my_df['Value'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = my_df['Value'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

my_df['Value'] = my_df['Value'].clip(lower_bound, upper_bound)
 
----


[source,python]
----
missing_v = my_df_2.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:\n", missing_v)
----

Imputation using the mean:
[source,python]
----
my_df_2['Value'].fillna(my_df_2['Value'].mean(), inplace=True)

== Questions

We will use 'train.csv' for the questions


=== Question 1 (2 points)

.. Please identify outliers in the 'SalePrice' column using the IQR method
 
=== Question 2 (2 points) 

.. Please cap the outliers in the 'SalePrice' column
 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Please identify how many columns have missing values
 

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Please replace missing values in 'LotFrontage' using the `mean`values
 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Please replace missing values in 'GarageType' using the `mode` values
