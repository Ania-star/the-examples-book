= 201 Project 04: Handling Outliers and Missing Values

In this project, we will understand the concept of how to identify and handle outliers and missing values in a dataset to ensure data quality and improve the performance of subsequent data analysis or machine learning models.

== Objectives

* Identify and handle outliers in a dataset
* Impute missing values in a dataset

== Dataset

. `/anvil/scratch/x-nzhou1/train.csv`

[NOTE]
====
Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations. They can occur due to variability in the data or experimental errors. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial because they can distort statistical analyses and models, leading to inaccurate results. Common methods for detecting outliers include the Z-score method and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. When data is missing, it can introduce bias and reduce the statistical power of the analysis. Common imputation techniques include `mean`, `median`, and `mode` imputation for numerical and categorical data, respectively.

We will use some example to demo the concepts as following

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd

example_outliers = {
    'Index': range(1, 11),
    'Value': [10, 12, 11, 13, 100, 12, 11, 10, 12, 110]
}

my_df = pd.DataFrame(example_outliers).to_csv('outliers.csv', index=False)
----

[source,python]
----
example_missing = {
    'Index': range(1, 11),
    'Value': [10, 12, 11, None, 13, 12, None, 10, 12, 11]
}

my_df_2 = pd.DataFrame(example_missing)
my_df_2.to_csv('missing.csv', index=False)
----



Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relation to the mean of a group of values. It is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. A Z-score of 0 indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score, whereas a Z-score of 1.0 indicates a value that is one standard deviation from the mean.

Example to use Z-score:
[source,python]
----
from scipy import stats

z_scores = stats.zscore(my_df['Value'])
abs_z_scores = np.abs(z_scores)
outliers = my_df[abs_z_scores > 3]
print("Outliers detected:\n", outliers)
----

Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:

[source,python]
----
Q1 = my_df['Value'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = my_df['Value'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

my_df['Value'] = my_df['Value'].clip(lower_bound, upper_bound)
 
----


[source,python]
----
missing_v = my_df_2.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:\n", missing_v)
----

Imputation using the mean:
[source,python]
----
my_df_2['Value'].fillna(my_df_2['Value'].mean(), inplace=True)

== Questions

We will use 'train.csv' for the questions


=== Question 1 (2 points)

.. Please identify outliers in the 'SalePrice' column using the IQR method
 
=== Question 2 (2 points) 

.. Please cap the outliers in the 'SalePrice' column
 
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Please identify how many columns have missing values
 

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Please replace missing values in 'LotFrontage' using the `mean`values
 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Please replace missing values in 'GarageType' using the `mode` values
