= 201 Project 02 - Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, we continue to explore NOAA weather data to understand its main characteristics, identify trends over time, and visualize the data in different ways.

== Project Objectives

* Calculate summary statistics
* Use `to_datetime()` to convert data format
* Visualize the data to better understand it

== Dataset

The dataset is from NOAA and contains daily weather observations for various stations. You can find more information about it in the following `readme-by_year.txt` file.

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/2010.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/readme-by_year.txt`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
 
[NOTE]
====
To use the pandas library to load the data from the file, we first need to import the pandas library. The following is an example to demonstrate the initial setup:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
----

.. First, use the readme file: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/readme-by_year.txt` to create a list of column titles named "column_names".
+

[TIP]
====
Use the specified `readme-by_year.txt` to understand the meaning of the following columns: 'ID', 'DATE', 'ELEMENT', 'VALUE', 'M-FLAG', 'Q-FLAG', 'S-FLAG', 'OBS-TIME'.
====

Next, load the dataset from `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/2010.csv` into a DataFrame named `my_df`, using `column_names` to add the column titles. (HINT: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html[`pd.read_csv()`] can help you with this!)

=== Question 2 (2 points)

* Display the first 10 rows of `my_df`.
* Display the column titles.
* Use `describe()` to show the summary statistics of the dataset.
* Use `shape` to display the shape of the DataFrame.
* Use `info()` to display the DataFrame information.

=== Question 3 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
The `to_datetime()` function in pandas converts data to a specialized datetime format. It can parse dates in various formats and convert them into datetime objects.
====

.. Please use `to_datetime()` to convert the 'DATE' column to datetime format.

[TIP]
====
You can find more information about `to_datetime` https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html[here].
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
We can visualize values over time to understand trends. You need to ensure that the date column is in datetime format. Then, you can use `Matplotlib` to create a line plot for "TMAX" values like this:

[source,python]
----
TMAX_df = my_df[my_df['ELEMENT'] == 'TMAX'].sort_values(by='DATE')
 
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
plt.plot(TMAX_df['DATE'], TMAX_df['VALUE'], label='TMAX')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('TMAX Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
----
====

.. Please create a line plot for 'TAVG' values over time to identify trends.

=== Question 5 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
You can also plot more than one value at once for easy comparison, such as TMAX and TMIN. You need to filter the DataFrame for these elements separately first, and then use Matplotlib to create line plots or histograms to visualize the distribution of these values, like this:

[source,python]
----
TMAX_df = my_df[my_df['ELEMENT'] == 'TMAX']
TMIN_df = my_df[my_df['ELEMENT'] == 'TMIN']

# Plot histograms for TMAX and TMIN values
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

# Histogram for TMAX
plt.hist(TMAX_df['VALUE'], bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='TMAX')

# Histogram for TMIN
plt.hist(TMIN_df['VALUE'], bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='TMIN')

plt.xlabel('Temperature')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Maximum and Minimum Temperatures')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
----
====

.. Please visualize the distributions of `TAVG` and `TMIN` values with a histogram plot.
