= TDM 20100: Project 5 -- More practice with pipelines

**Motivation:**  We continue to practice how to use pipelines.

**Context:** Pipelines enable us to work on data across many files.

**Scope:** Pipelines and pattern matching in Bash

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Learn about using pattern matching in bash pipelines.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/` (airplane data)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election` (election data)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv` (grocery store data)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/breweries.csv` (breweries data)
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv` (ice cream review data)

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

For this question, use the flight files found here:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/[12]*.csv`

a.  Make a list of all of the values that appear in column 9, namely, the UniqueCarrier values.  (These are abbreviations for the airlines.)  For each such airline, list the number of flights on each airline.  The list is short enough that you can display the full list of airlines and the number of flights on each airline.

b.  Make a list of all of the TailNum values that appear in column 11 BUT do not print this list!  Just print the number of (distinct) TailNum values.

[TIP]
====
You can just use `uniq` instead of `uniq -c` for part b, since you do not need to keep track of the counts.
====

[HINT]
====
There are more than 10,000 TailNum values, so please *do not* print the full list of TailNum values.  You only need to print the *total number of (unique) TailNum values* that occur.
====

[NOTE]
====
Note:  There is 1 TailNum painted onto the tail of each airplane, which uniquely identifies that airplane.  So, in part b, you are printing the number of airplanes that have flown in the United States!
====


.Deliverables
====
- a. Print a list of all of all UniqueCarrier values and how many times that each UniqueCarrier appears.
- b. Print the number of (distinct) TailNum values that occur (do not print the list itself; there are more than 10,000 values!)
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

In the grocery store data:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv`

how many (distinct) PRODUCT_NUM values appear?

(You only need to print the number of distinct PRODUCT_NUM values.  Please do NOT print the entire list.  There are more than 100,000 such values!)

.Deliverables
====
- Print the number of (distinct) PRODUCT_NUM values that appear.  (Do not print the list itself!)
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Consider the election files:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont*.txt`

Using the `cut` command with '|' as the delimiter, cut out the 8th field, which are the names of the donors.  (Be sure to cautiously use `head` whenever you look at the output from a pipeline, so that you do not print millions of rows of output.)

Now add to the pipeline another `cut` command with a comma as the delimiter, cut out the 1st field, which will be the family name of the donors.  (Again, be sure to carefully use `head` whenever you look at pipeline output.)

Finally, finish the pipeline, to get the 10 most popular last names of donors (be sure to print how many times each of these 10 most popular last names occur).

[TIP]
====
You do *not* need to use `grep` on this question.
====


[HINT]
====
The two most popular last names of donors are:

[source, bash]
----
1225266 JOHNSON
1654933 SMITH
----
====


.Deliverables
====
- The 10 most popular last names of donors (and the number of times each of these 10 most popular last names occurs).
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

In Project 3, Question 4, you extracted the city and state from the donation data.  In this question, *instead of studying the election data*, consider (instead) the breweries data in this file:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/breweries.csv`

Discover the 10 city-and-state pairs in which the largest number of breweries are located (and the number of breweries in each of these city-and-state pairs).

[TIP]
====
You do *not* need to use `grep` on this question.
====

[HINT]
====
The two most popular city-and-state pairs for breweries are:

[source, bash]
----
    499 Philadelphia,PA
    512 Chicago,IL
----
====


.Deliverables
====
- The 10 city-and-state pairs in which the largest number of breweries are located (and the number of breweries in each of these city-and-state pairs).
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

In this ice cream reviews file:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/icecream/combined/reviews.csv`

We can use `grep salty` to see that 335 lines of this file have the word "salty".  By default, `grep` pays attention to the case, so (for instance) these 335 occurrences do not include "Salty" or "SALTY" or "saLTy".  If we want to search without paying attention to the case, we will get more occurrences of the pattern.  In this case, `grep -i salty` allows us to see that 350 lines of this file have the word "salty" when we do not pay attention to the case.  The "-i" stands for a case-insensitive search.

Similarly, there are 1972 lines that include the exact pattern "sweet", but if use a case-insensitive search, there are 2080 lines that include the pattern "sweet" without paying attention to case.

How many lines of the file include the exact pattern "chocolate"?

How many lines of the file include the pattern "chocolate" as a case-insensitive search, in other words, without paying attention to the case?

.Deliverables
====
- The number of lines of the file that include the exact pattern "chocolate".
- The number of lines of the file that include the pattern "chocolate" as a case-insensitive search, in other words, without paying attention to the case.

== Submitting your Work

You now have some experience using pattern matching inside pipelines of bash commands!  Your skills from one project to the next are growing!  Please refer back to previous projects, and ask questions anytime that you need advice or help!

.Items to submit
====
- firstname-lastname-project4.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
