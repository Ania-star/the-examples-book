= TDM 20100: Project 7 -- Awk

**Motivation:** Now we will learn about associative arrays in awk, which allow you to (for instance) add entries in one column, grouped according to the entries in another column.

**Context:** We learn how to use associative arrays in awk.

**Scope:** associative arrays in `awk`

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Use associative arrays in `awk`
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

In Project 6, Question 1, we added all of the sales amounts in dollars from column 22 of this file of liquor sales in Iowa:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/iowa_liquor_sales/iowa_liquor_sales_cleaner.txt`

Now, we can (instead) use associative arrays in awk to add the sales amounts in dollars for each store (from column 4):  Grouping the sales amounts according to the store, add the sale amounts for each store.  For your output, on each line, print the dollar amount for the sales of each store, and the store too.  Sort the output in numerical order.  It is OK to just print the tail of the result, so that you will print 10 lines of output.

[NOTE]
====
The bottom 4 lines are given below.
====

[NOTE]
====
Because these numbers are really large, instead of using `sort -n` you need to use `sort -g` which can handle numbers in scientific notation.  These numbers are tens and hundreds of millions.

.Deliverables
====
- Print the 10 largest sales amounts according to the stores.  (The 4 largest are shown above.)

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Back in Project 6, Question 2, we added all of the donation dollar amounts from the 1980 election data:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt`

Now, instead, let's add the donation dollar amounts in each state:  Grouping the transaction amounts according to the state, add the donation dollar amounts for each state.  For your output, on each line, print the dollar amount and the state, and sort the output in numerical order.  It is OK to just print the tail of the result, so that you will print 10 lines of output.

[NOTE]
====
The line 17916669 without a state corresponds to the sum of the donation amounts where the state was blank!
====

.Deliverables
====
- Print the 10 largest total dollar amounts of donations, and the analogous states where those donations were made.  (The 4th largest one is a blank state and that is OK.)
====



=== Question 3 (2 pts)

In this *sample* file of beer reviews `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

Consider the mean beer scores on each date.

Find the three dates on which the mean score is a 5.

[NOTE]
====
This week, we are using only the sample file: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

You *DO NOT* need to use the (much larger) file from last week:  `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews.csv`
====

[NOTE]
====
A mean `score` of "5" is a perfect score, so you can add up the scores on each date, and the number of reviews on each date, and print the ratio of the sum of scores and the number of reviews, and then sort the results numerically, and print only the tail.
====

[NOTE]
====
The date is in the 3rd field and the score is the last field on each line, i.e., the score is stored in `$NF`.
====

.Deliverables
====
- In the reviews sample file, show the three dates on which the mean `score` is a 5.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Consider the data in the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv`

Solve the same question from Project 6, Question 4, again, but this time use associative arrays.  By using associative arrays, you can solve this question with just 1 line of awk.  You should just use awk one time (not 4 times).  By using associative arrays, you can add the total amounts of the values in the `SPEND` column, grouping the values according to the `STORE_R` column, and print the results for all 4 regions using awk just one time.


.Deliverables
====
- Print the sum of the `SPEND` column values corresponding to each of the four store regions.  Use `awk` only one time (by using associative arrays).
====


=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Find the average `DepDelay` from each `Origin` airport in 1990, i.e., using the data in the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv`

You *do not need* to print the output for all of the `Origin` airports.  Instead, it is OK to include:

`grep 'EWR\|JFK\|LGA'`

at the end of your pipeline, so that you are only displaying the average departure delays for the three huge `Origin` airports in New York City.

.Deliverables
====
- Print the average departure delays for the three biggest airports located in New York City, namely, the average departure delay from EWR, the average departure delay from JFK, and the average departure delay from LGA.

== Submitting your Work

Please let us know (anytime!) if you need help as you are learning about associative arrays in awk.



.Items to submit
====
- firstname-lastname-project7.ipynb
====

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, comments (in markdown or with hashtags), and code output, even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See xref:submissions.adoc[the instructions on how to double check your submission].

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file submitted in Gradescope does not **show** all of the information you expect it to, including the output for each question result (i.e., the results of running your code), and also comments about your work on each question. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.  Please do not wait until Friday afternoon or evening to complete and submit your work.
