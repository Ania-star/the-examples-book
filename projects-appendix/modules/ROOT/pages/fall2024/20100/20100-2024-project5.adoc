= TDM 20100: Project 5 -- Pipelines, continued

**Motivation:** In this project, we'll continue to cement the concept of pipelines into your toolset. We will gradually work up to more complex examples of piping and pipelines, culminating in complicated pipelines that provide loads of valuable data processing at once, along with some that begin to perform some data analysis!

**Context:** This project will incorporate commands learned in all the previous ones, so reviewing projects 1-4 may help with completion of this project.

**Scope:** Pipes, pipelines, data processing, Bash, GNU, CLI

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Build basic pipelines that reformat and analyze data
- Build complex pipelines that process data into appropriate formats for analysis
- Perform basic data analysis using pipelines in `bash`
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
