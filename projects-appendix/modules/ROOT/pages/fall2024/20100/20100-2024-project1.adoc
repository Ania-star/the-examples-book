= TDM 20100: Project 1 -- Welcome to the CLI!

**Motivation:** The _Command Line Interface_, often referred to simply as the _CLI_, is the bread-and-butter of working with computers. With it, we can navigate through files, search for patterns, create, modify, and delete thousands of files with a single line of code, and more! In the next few projects we'll be taking some time to review the basics of Anvil (as its been a long summer!) before learning all about the CLI and what it is capable of. In just a few weeks, you'll be well on your way to mastery of the command line!

**Context:** Experience working in Anvil will make this project easier to start but is not a prequisite.

**Scope:** Anvil, Jupyter Labs, CLI, Bash, GNU, filesystem navigation

.Learning Objectives:
****
- Remember how to work in Anvil
- Learn how to navigate the CLI
- Learn how to navigate a filesystem in the CLI
****

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

It's been a long summer, so let's start our first project this semester off with a quick review of https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/anvil[Anvil]. In case you haven't already, visit https://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu[ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu] and log in using your ACCESS account credentials. If you don't already have an account, follow https://the-examples-book.com/book/setup[these instructions] to set one up. If you've forgotten your account credentials or are having other issues related to Anvil, please reach out to datamine-help@purdue.edu with as much information as possible about your issue.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your ACCESS account credentials may not necessarily be the same as your Purdue Career account.
====

Once logged in, start a new Anvil session for a few hours (try not to use more than 3 for the moment) and 1 CPU core.

[NOTE]
====
For a reminder on how to start a new session on Anvil:

In the upper-middle part of your screen, you should see a dropdown button labeled `The Data Mine`. Click on it, then select `Jupyter Notebook` from the options that appear. If you followed all the previous steps correctly, you should now be on a screen that looks like this:

image::f24-101-p1-1.png[OnDemand Jupyter Lab, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand Jupyter Lab"]

If your screen doesn't look like this, please try and select the correct dropdown option again or visit seminar for more assistance.
====

For this first question, we're going to have you get used to working with Jupyter. To start, upload https://the-examples-book.com/projects/_attachments/project_template.ipynb[this project template] to Jupyter and fill in your name and the project number as needed, selecting `seminar` (not `seminar-r`) as your https://the-examples-book.com/tools/anvil/jupyter-lab-kernels[kernel].

Then, run the following Python in a code cell. For a more in-depth reminder on working in Jupyter, feel free to take a look at https://the-examples-book.com/projects/fall2024/10100/10100-2024-project1[this year's 10100 project 1] or https://the-examples-book.com/tools/anvil/jupyter[this guide on Jupyter].

[source, bash]
----
print("Hello World!")
----

Then, in a new code cell, run the following:

[source, bash]
----
%%bash

echo Hello World!
----

The first line, `%%bash`, is _cell magic_, which tells our kernel to expect a different language than the default. (In this case, the default is Python and we are telling it to use bash instead.)  When using cell magic, it is necessary to ahve the cell magic as the first line in the cell.  If (for instance) a comment is the first thing in the cell, then the cell magic will fail.

The second line consists of `echo Hello World!`. `echo` is a Bash command similar to `print()` in Python, and we have it print "Hello World!"

As for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)[Bash] (short for _Bourne-Again-SHell_), you can think of it as a programming language for the command line. Bash has a _lot_ of handy tools and commands to learn, and the rest of this project will be spent beginning to learn about Bash.

The _terminal_ is what we call the area we typically work with the CLI in. While we can run Bash in our Jupyter notebook (as we did above), you will typically work directly in a terminal and throughout this semester we would recommend that you first run your Bash code in a terminal before copying the finished code over to your Jupyter notebook. To open a terminal on Anvil, open a new tab and select `Terminal`, where you'll be greeted with a window that looks somewhat like the following (albeit `jaxmattfair` will be replaced by your access username.)

image::f24-201-p1-1.png[OnDemand Terminal, width=792, height=500, loading=lazy, title="OnDemand Terminal"]

Try typing `echo Hello World!` and hitting enter. You should see the terminal print "Hello World!" before waiting for another command. 

To get credit for this question, write a command using `echo` that prints "Hello X!" where "X" is replaced with your name. Be sure to copy your finished command into your Jupyter notebook and run it using _cell magic_ to get credit for your work.

.Deliverables
====
- A command to print "Hello X!" (where "X" is replaced with your name) and the results of running it
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Knowing how to navigate in the shell is helpful.  A few notes:

Absolute paths start with a '/', like this:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/`

Relative paths do not start with a '/', like this:

`subset`

The 'cd' command is used to change directories.

By default, 'cd' just changes your location back to your home directory.

You can type 'cd' with absolute paths or relative paths, for instance:

[source, bash]
----
%%bash
cd /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/
----

or like this:

[source, bash]
----
%%bash
cd /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/
cd subset
----

If you want to go back to a directory one level higher, type 'cd ..'

For instance, try this, which first moves our location to the flight subset directory, and then back to the `flights` directory, and then back to the `data` directory.

[source, bash]
----
%%bash
cd /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/
cd ..
cd ..
pwd
----

The `pwd` command prints the working directory.

The `ls` command prints the contents of the working directory, with only the file names.

Dr Ward likes to run `ls -la` (those are lowercase letter L's, not number 1's), which shows information about the files in the directories.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each bash cell in Jupyter Lab is executed independently, starting from your home directory, as if nothing had been previously run (ignoring anything that you did in earlier cells).
====

Which years of flight data are in the directory:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/`?

Which years of flight data are in the directory:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/`?

In which of the two directories are the files bigger?

.Deliverables
====
- The year range of flight data in the two directories indicated above, and which directory has larger files.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 2, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

We can use the `head` and the `tail` commands to see the top lines and the bottom lines of a file.  By default, we see 10 lines of output, in each case.  We can use the `-n` flag to change the number of lines of output that we see.  For instance:

[source, bash]
----
%%bash
head -n6 /anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1987.csv
----

shows the first 6 lines of the `1987.csv` file in the flights subset directory.  This includes the header line and also the information about the first 5 flights.

The `cut` command usually takes two flags, namely:

the `-d` flag that indicates how the data in a flag is delimited (in other words, what character is placed between the pieces of data), and

the `-f` flag that indicates which fields we want to cut.

Use the `cut` command to extract all of the origin airports and destination airports from the `1987.csv` file in the flight `subset` directory, and store the resulting origin and destination airports into a file in your home directory.

You can save the results of your work in bash in a file in your home directory like this:

[TIP]
====
%%bash
myworkinbash >$HOME/originsanddestinations.csv
====

.Deliverables
====
- Show the head of the file originsanddestinations.csv that you created.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Use the `grep` command to find data in the `1987.csv` file in the flights subset directory that contain the pattern `IND`.  Save all of the lines of that `1987.csv` file into a new file in your home directory called `indyflights.csv`.

.Deliverables
====
- Show the head of the file indyflights.csv that you created.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Okay, so we know how to get our shell to tell us what directory we're in, what that directory contains, and move to different directories relative to our current directory. However, it would be painfully inconvenient to always have to figure out the exact path to where we want to go depending on where we currently are, instead of just having an exact, absolute location that works no matter where we are.

Introducing: _absolute pathing_! So far, we've been using _relative pathing_, which is simply when the path we try and `cd` into or interact with is given relative to where we currently are. For example, `cd ../` and cd `folder2` are both examples of relative pathing. Absolute pathing is when the path we are interacting with makes no assumptions on where we are, and instead gives the _entire_ path to the file, all the way down to the ultimate parent directory called the _root directory_ or just _root_. Absolute pathing can be performed by starting your path with a `/`. For example, `cd /folder2` would be trying to move into a directory called `folder2` that is contained by the root directory.

One last note is that there are lots of shorthand ways to refer to things. For example, in the shell we currently have defined a number of variables and aliases to special filepaths that are often used. For example, `~` is shorthand for your **home directory**, which is where most of the user-facing files are stored. If you do `cd ~` or even just `cd`, and then print your working directory, it will always look something like this (on Anvil): `/home/x-username`. You can also refer to home using `$HOME`. Similarly we provide you with a directory for scratch work called `$SCRATCH`, which is actually located at `/anvil/scratch/x-username`. 

[NOTE]
====
To see a full list of variables defined for your shell, you can run `set -o posix ; set`. Alternatively, you can use `printenv` for a more verbose output.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Do not** change the values of your shell variables without a full understanding of what they do first, as it can cause your terminal to not work the way you expect it to (albeit it will be fixable).
====

For this question, we want you to demonstrate your understanding of both relative and absolute pathing. Feel free to explore the filesystem on your own, as you can't really damage anything using only `ls` and `cd` as we've demonstrated throughout the project. At minimum, perform the following actions each in their own code cell for clear separation between results.

. `pwd`, then use relative pathing to navigate to your `$SCRATCH` directory. `pwd` for your final results
. `pwd`, then use absolute pathing to navigate to your `$SCRATCH` directory. `pwd` for your final results
. `pwd`, use relative pathing to navigate to the root directory, then `pwd`. Use relative pathing to navigate back to your `$HOME` directory from root, and `pwd` again.

.Deliverables
====
- Use relative pathing to get to `$SCRATCH`
- Use absolute pathing to get to `$SCRATCH`
- Use relative pathing to get to root, and then back to `$HOME`
- Include `pwd` statements as stated to show results of each step

== Submitting your Work

With this last question completed, you've successfully made your first dive into the wonderful world of the command line, and can now successfully navigate just about any filesystem we throw at you! This may not seem like it was a hugely difficult project, but the skills you learned in this project are foundational tools that, when built upon, are extremely powerful skills that offer huge benefits in both research and industry.

In the next project we'll go one step further than simply navigating the filesystem and learn how to manipulate it. By creating, destroying, and moving files, we'll be that much closer to having a full functionality through only the CLI.

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project1.ipynb

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
