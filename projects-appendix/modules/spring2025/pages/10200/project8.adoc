= TDM 10200: Python Project 8 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** It is helpful to learn how to define our own functions in Python.

**Context:** In this project, we learn how to design functions and use them.

**Scope:** Of course, we start with the basics and learn several one-line functions, with lots of examples.

.Learning Objectives:
****
- User-defined functions in Python.
****

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following datasets:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

Example 1:

Finding the average weight of Olympic athletes in a given country.

[source,python]
----
def avgweights (mycountry: str) -> float:
    """
    The avgweights function takes a 3-character string as input, representing the NOC code for a country, and returns the average weight of Olympic athletes in that country.

    Args:
    mycountry (str): This is a 3-character string as input, representing the NOC code for a country

    Returns:
    countryweight (float): This is the average weight of Olympic athletes in that country.  It is a decimal number, which is called a float in Python.
    """
    myDF = pd.read_csv('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv')
    countryweight = myDF[myDF['NOC'] == mycountry]['Weight'].mean()
    return countryweight

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Consider this user-defined function, which makes a table that shows the percentages of values in each category:

[source,R]
----
makeatable <- function(x) {prop.table(table(x, useNA="always"))}
----

If we do something like this, with a column from a data frame:

[source,R]
----
makeatable(myDF$mycolumn)
----

Then it is the same as running this:

[source,R]
----
prop.table(table(myDF$mycolumn, useNA="always"))
----

In other words, `makeatable` is a user-defined function that makes a table, including all `NA` values, and expresses the result as percentages.  That is what the `prop.table` does here.

Now consider the DeathRecords data set:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`

a.  Try the function `makeatable` on the `Sex` column of the DeathRecords.

b.  Also try the function `makeatable` on the `MaritalStatus` column of the DeathRecords.


.Deliverables
====
- Use the `makeatable` function to display table of values from the `Sex` column of the DeathRecords.

- Use the `makeatable` function to display table of values from the `MaritalStatus` column of the DeathRecords.
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Define a function called `teenagecount` as follows:

[source,R]
----
teenagecount <- function(x) {length(x[(x >= 13) & (x <= 19) & (!is.na(x))])}
----

a. Try this function on the `Age` column of the DeathRecords.

b. Also try this function on the `Age` column of the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

.Deliverables
====
- Display the number of teenagers in the DeathRecords data.
- Display the number of teenagers in the Olympics Athlete Events data.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

The `nchar` function gives the number of characters in a string.  The `which.max` function finds the position of the maximum value.  Define the function:

[source,R]
----
longesttest <- function(x) {x[which.max(nchar(x))]}
----

a. Use the function `longesttest` to find the longest review in the `text` column of the beer reviews data set `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

b. Also use the function `longesttest` to find the longest name in the `NAME` column of the 1980 election data:

[source, R]
----
library(data.table)
myDF <- fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt", quote="")
names(myDF) <- c("CMTE_ID", "AMNDT_IND", "RPT_TP", "TRANSACTION_PGI", "IMAGE_NUM", "TRANSACTION_TP", "ENTITY_TP", "NAME", "CITY", "STATE", "ZIP_CODE", "EMPLOYER", "OCCUPATION", "TRANSACTION_DT", "TRANSACTION_AMT", "OTHER_ID", "TRAN_ID", "FILE_NUM", "MEMO_CD", "MEMO_TEXT", "SUB_ID")
----


.Deliverables
====
- Print the longest review in the `text` column of the beer reviews data set `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`
- Print the longest name in the `NAME` column of the 1980 election data.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

a. Create your own function called `mostpopulardate` that finds the most popular date in a column of dates, as well as the number of times that date occurs.

b. Test your function `mostpopulardate` on the `date` column of the beer reviews data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

c. Also test your function `mostpopulardate` on the `TRANSACTION_DT` column of the 1980 election data.

.Deliverables
====
- a. Define your function called `mostpopulardate`

- b. Use your function `mostpopulardate` to find the most popular `date` in the beer reviews data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

- c. Also use your function `mostpopulardate` to find the most popular transaction date from the 1980 election data.
====


=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Define a function called `myaveragedelay` that takes a 3-letter string (correspding to an airport code) and finds the average departure delays (after removing the NA values) from the `DepDelay` column of the 1990 flight data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv` for flights departing from that airport.

Try your function on the Indianapolis "IND" flights.  In other words, `myaveragedelay("IND")` should print 5.96977225672878 because the flights with `Origin` airport "IND" have an average departure delay of 5.9 minutes.

Try your function on the New York City "JFK" flights.  In other words, `myaveragedelay("JFK")` should print 11.8572741063607 because the flights with `Origin` airport "JFK" have an average departure delay of 11.8 minutes.

.Deliverables
====
- a. Define your function called `myaveragedelay`

- b. Use `myaveragedelay("IND")` to print the average departure delays for flights with Origin airport "IND".

- c. Use `myaveragedelay("JFK")` to print the average departure delays for flights with Origin airport "JFK".

== Submitting your Work

Please make sure that you added comments for each question, which explain your thinking about your method of solving each question.  Please also make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

If you have any questions or issues regarding this project, please feel free to ask in seminar, over Piazza, or during office hours.

Prior to submitting your work, you need to put your work xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[into the project template], and re-run all of the code in your Jupyter notebook and make sure that the results of running that code is visible in your template.  Please check the xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[detailed instructions on how to ensure that your submission is formatted correctly]. To download your completed project, you can right-click on the file in the file explorer and click 'download'.

Once you upload your submission to Gradescope, make sure that everything appears as you would expect to ensure that you don't lose any points.

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project7.ipynb

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
