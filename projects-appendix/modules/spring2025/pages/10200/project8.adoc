= TDM 10200: Python Project 8 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** It is helpful to learn how to define our own functions in Python.

**Context:** In this project, we learn how to design functions and use them.

**Scope:** Of course, we start with the basics and learn several one-line functions, with lots of examples.

.Learning Objectives:
****
- User-defined functions in Python.
****

== Dataset(s)

This project will use the following datasets:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/election/itcont1980.txt`

def avgweights (mycountry: str) -> float:
    """
    The avgweights function takes a 3-character string as input, representing the NOC code for a country, and returns the average weight of Olympic athletes in that country.

    Args:
    mycountry (str): This is a 3-character string as input, representing the NOC code for a country

    Returns:
    countryweight (float): This is the average weight of Olympic athletes in that country.  It is a decimal number, which is called a float in Python.
    """
    myDF = pd.read_csv('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv')
    countryweight = myDF[myDF['NOC'] == mycountry]['Weight'].mean()

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Consider this user-defined function, which makes a table that shows the percentages of values in each category:

[source,python]
----
def makeatable (myseries: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    """
    The makeatable function takes a Pandas Series as input,
    with any type of data in the Series (for instance, it might be a column of a data frame)
    and returns the percentages of the data of each type.

    Args:
    myseries (pd.Series): This is any type of Series that we want to study, 
    
    Returns:
    makeatable (pd.Series): This is a Pandas Series with the percentages of the data of each type.
    """
    mypercentages = myseries.value_counts(normalize = True)
    return mypercentages
----

If we do something like this, with a column from a data frame:

[source,python]
----
makeatable(myDF['put my column name here'])
----

Then it is the same as getting the `value_counts(normalize = True)` for the series.

In other words, `makeatable` is a user-defined function that returns a series, with the value counts expressed as a percentage.

Now consider the DeathRecords data set:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`

a.  Try the function `makeatable` on the `Sex` column of the DeathRecords.

b.  Also try the function `makeatable` on the `MaritalStatus` column of the DeathRecords.

.Deliverables
====
- Use the `makeatable` function to display table of values from the `Sex` column of the DeathRecords.

- Use the `makeatable` function to display table of values from the `MaritalStatus` column of the DeathRecords.
====


=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Define a function called `teenagecount` as follows:

[source,python]
----
def teenagecount (myseries: pd.Series) -> int:
    """
    The teenagecount function takes a Pandas Series as input,
    with any type of data in the Series (for instance, it might be a column of a data frame)
    and returns the number of data points that are between 13 and 19 (inclusive).

    Args:
    myseries (pd.Series): This is any type of Series that we want to study, 
    
    Returns:
    teenagecount (int): This is an integer that shows the number of values between 13 and 19 in the data.
    """
    teenagecount = len(myseries[(myseries >= 13) & (myseries <= 19)])
    return teenagecount
----

a. Try this function on the `Age` column of the DeathRecords file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`

b. Also try this function on the `Age` column of the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`

.Deliverables
====
- Display the number of teenagers in the DeathRecords data.
- Display the number of teenagers in the Olympics Athlete Events data.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

The function `max` in Python can find the longest string in a series, if we use the option `key=len`, as described here:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-longest-string-in-list/

Define the function:

[source,python]
----
def longesttest (mydata: pd.Series) -> str:
    """
    The longesttest function takes a Pandas Series as input,
    containing strings, and returns the longest string.

    Args:
    mydata (pd.Series): This is any type of Series that contains strings which we want to study, 
    
    Returns:
    mylongeststring (str): This is the longest of the strings in the Pandas Series
    """
    mylongeststring = max(mydata, key=len)
    return mylongeststring
----

a. Use the function `longesttest` to find the longest review in the `text` column of the beer reviews data set `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

b. Also use the function `longesttest` to find the longest name in the `NAME` column of the 1980 election data.  Hint:  On part (b), Pandas does not recognize that the `NAME` column contains strings by default, so you might try this way, to force Pandas to treat the `NAME` column as strings:   `longesttest(myDF['NAME'].astype(str))`

.Deliverables
====
- Print the longest review in the `text` column of the beer reviews data set `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`
- Print the longest name in the `NAME` column of the 1980 election data.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

a. Create your own function called `mostpopulardate` that finds the most popular date in a column of dates, as well as the number of times that date occurs.  Hint:  There are multiple methods available here for doing this:  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-display-most-frequent-value-in-a-pandas-series

b. Test your function `mostpopulardate` on the `date` column of the beer reviews data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

c. Also test your function `mostpopulardate` on the `TRANSACTION_DT` column of the 1980 election data.

.Deliverables
====
- a. Define your function called `mostpopulardate`

- b. Use your function `mostpopulardate` to find the most popular `date` in the beer reviews data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/reviews_sample.csv`

- c. Also use your function `mostpopulardate` to find the most popular transaction date from the 1980 election data.
====


=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Define a function called `myaveragedelay` that takes a 3-letter string (correspding to an airport code) and finds the average departure delays (after removing the NA values) from the `DepDelay` column of the 1990 flight data `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/1990.csv` for flights departing from that airport.

Try your function on the Indianapolis "IND" flights.  In other words, `myaveragedelay("IND")` should print 5.9697722567287785 because the flights with `Origin` airport "IND" have an average departure delay of 5.9 minutes.

Try your function on the New York City "JFK" flights.  In other words, `myaveragedelay("JFK")` should print 11.857274106360704 because the flights with `Origin` airport "JFK" have an average departure delay of 11.8 minutes.

.Deliverables
====
- a. Define your function called `myaveragedelay`

- b. Use `myaveragedelay("IND")` to print the average departure delays for flights with Origin airport "IND".

- c. Use `myaveragedelay("JFK")` to print the average departure delays for flights with Origin airport "JFK".
