= TDM 20200: Web Scraping Project 5 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** We learn how to handle pages with differences in style.  In particular, we consider pages that have a next page and pages that do not have a next page.

**Context:** We will use lxml for web scraping in this project, with XPath queries.  We will first analyze example pages, and then will build a powerful function to automate scraping pages.

**Scope:** Web Scraping in Python

.Learning Objectives:
****
- We continue to learn how to scrape data more systematically from the web
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

In this project we will scrape data from the following website:

- https://books.toscrape.com

== Questions

Preface to the Project:

Recall that there are 50 types of pages on the Books To Scrape website.  We already learned that we can get these 50 pages as follows:

[source, python]
----
import requests

from lxml import html

mytree = html.fromstring(requests.get("https://books.toscrape.com").content)

myurls = ['https://books.toscrape.com/' + element.attrib['href'] for element in mytree.xpath('//li/ul/li/a')]

mylistofurls = [element for element in myurls]
----

If you explore these 50 links, you will see that some of them are individual pages, for instance, consider:

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/sports-and-games_17/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/humor_30/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/novels_46/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/parenting_28/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/politics_48/index.html

and some of the categories have multiple pages, for instance:

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/food-and-drink_33/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/sequential-art_5/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/mystery_3/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/young-adult_21/index.html

https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/fiction_10/index.html

Whenever a category has multiple pages, we can safely change the `index.html` to `page-1.html` and then the following pages are `page-2.html` and `page-3.html` and so on....

BUT on the Books To Scrape website, the categories with just one page do not have that option.  So it makes sense to handle these two types of pages separately.



=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Write a function called `myscrapingfunction` that works as follows:

It takes a url called `myurl` as input and returns a list of all of the books from that url's category.

For instance,

`myscrapingfunction('https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/index.html')` should return a list of 11 url's like this:

[source, python]
----
['https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../its-only-the-himalayas_981/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../full-moon-over-noahs-ark-an-odyssey-to-mount-ararat-and-beyond_811/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../see-america-a-celebration-of-our-national-parks-treasured-sites_732/index.html',
...
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../the-road-to-little-dribbling-adventures-of-an-american-in-britain-notes-from-a-small-island-2_277/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../neither-here-nor-there-travels-in-europe_198/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/travel_2/../../../1000-places-to-see-before-you-die_1/index.html']
----

and, as another example,

`myscrapingfunction('https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/index.html')` should return a list of 29 url's like this:

[source, python]
----
['https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../birdsong-a-story-in-pictures_975/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../the-bear-and-the-piano_967/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../the-secret-of-dreadwillow-carse_944/index.html',
...
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../diary-of-a-minecraft-zombie-book-1-a-scare-of-a-dare-an-unofficial-minecraft-book_99/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../matilda_32/index.html',
 'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/../../../charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-charlie-bucket-1_13/index.html']
----

Here is pseudocode for how Dr Ward defined his function `myscrapingfunction` with input `myurl`:

`import requests`

`from lxml import html`

Make an empty list called `mytemplist`.

Let `mytree` be defined for `myurl` just like in Project 4 (and earlier).

Create `mystub` from `myurl` by using a string replace of `'index.html'` by `''` (in other words, remove `'index.html'` from `myurl`).

Extend `mytemplist` by the list `[mystub + element.attrib['href'] for element in mytree.xpath('//h3/a')]` (this basically gets the books from page 1 of the category corresponding to `myurl`).

Set `mycounter` to be 1.

While `len([element for element in mytree.xpath('//li[@class="next"]/a')])` is strictly positive (in other words, while there are still "next" pages to handle, do the following:

Increment the value of `mycounter` by 1.

Create a variable `mynewurl` from concatenating together these four things:

[source, python]
----
mystub
'page-'
mycounter (converted to a string)
'.html'
----

Create `mytree` from `mynewurl`

and then extend `mytemplist` by the list `[mystub + element.attrib['href'] for element in mytree.xpath('//h3/a')]` (this basically gets the books from the page numbered `mycounter` of the category corresponding to `myurl`)

Now the `while` loop is over, and the function should return `mytemplist`.

.Deliverables
====
- Demonstrate that `myscrapingfunction` works by running it on each of the 10 example URLs given in the preface to the project.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Run the function `myscrapingfunction` on each element of `mylistofurls`.

You should get a list and each element should itself be a list of the URLs for the books in the respective categories.

.Deliverables
====
- Show the results from running the function `myscrapingfunction` on each element of `mylistofurls`.  It is not necessary to give all of the output; for instance, the first several elements of the resulting list are sufficient to show.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 2, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Create an empty list called `mybiglist`.  Then use list comprehension to extend `mybiglist` for each element in the list from question 2.  As a result, `mybiglist` should have the URLs for all 1000 books at the Books To Scrape website.

.Deliverables
====
- Show the head and tail of `mybiglist`.
- Verify that `mybiglist` has 1000 URLs.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Write a function that takes a category from Books To Scrape, and lists all of the individual prices of the books from that category.  Do not run a function on the individual book URLs!  Instead, modify the two occurrences of `mytemplist.extend` from Question 1, so that you extract all of the prices from the category pages.  To get the price of the books on a category page, search for a `p` tag with `@class="price_color"`.

For instance, when we run the function on:

`https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/childrens_11/index.html`

it should print:


[source, python]
----
['£54.64',
 '£36.89',
 '£56.13',
 '£58.08',
 '£13.47',
 '£12.96',
 '£22.08',
 '£23.57',
 '£18.28',
 '£53.95',
 '£25.08',
 '£35.96',
 '£52.87',
 '£34.41',
 '£32.38',
 '£22.54',
 '£56.07',
 '£48.77',
 '£43.59',
 '£26.33',
 '£16.26',
 '£28.54',
 '£37.52',
 '£10.79',
 '£10.62',
 '£10.66',
 '£52.88',
 '£28.34',
 '£22.85']
----

or if you run it on:

`https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/science_22/index.html`

it should print:

[source, python]
----
['£42.96',
 '£57.36',
 '£44.74',
 '£37.55',
 '£55.91',
 '£28.41',
 '£10.01',
 '£13.76',
 '£16.28',
 '£13.03',
 '£57.35',
 '£25.83',
 '£30.60',
 '£29.45']
----


.Deliverables
====
- Demonstrate that your function works, by testing it on the categories suggested above.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Now add the prices of all 1000 books.  You will need to remove the British pound symbol from each (you can use the `replace` function for this).  Verify that the total amount of the costs of all of the books from the Books To Scrape website is 35070.35 British pounds altogether.

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
