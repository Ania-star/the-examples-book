= TDM 20200: Mapping:  Project 9 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** We continue to learn how to plot maps in Python.

**Context:** We will focus on a broader selection of maps.

**Scope:** Mapping

.Learning Objectives:
****
- We continue to learn how to make maps in Python
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

In this project we will use the following mapping data:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/nps/nps_boundary.shp`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/boundaries/cb_2018_us_state_20m.shp`

== Questions

Load Pandas as Geopandas as follows:

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
----

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

The maps for the National Park Service are available in this shapefile:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/nps/nps_boundary.shp`

If you try to plot all 437 shape files from this data set, you will find that the map is hard to see, because the parks are spread out.

Let's agree to only view the parks from the 48 continental United States, plus the District of Columbia.

To do this, we need to remove the parks from Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands.

There is also one park called `American Memorial Park` which is located in American Samoa but the `STATE` value is listed as `NaN`.  It is OK to drop this park too.

There should be 396 parks remaining.  Plot the boundaries of these 396 parks.

.Deliverables
====
- Remove the parks discussed above, then plot the boundaries of the remaining 396 parks.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

The plot from Question 1 might make more sense if we plot the parks from a specific state with a lot of parks.  California has the most parks.  For this question, make a plot that contains only the parks from California.

(If you look at the maps in Questions 1 and 2 separately, does the map from Question 1 make more sense now?  Can you see where California is located in the map from Question 1, on the west side of the map?)

.Deliverables
====
- Make a plot that contains only the parks from California
- Be sure to document your work from Question 2, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Now we merge the data from two data sets.

The first data set is the data from Question 1, still excluding the data from Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and also excluding the data from the `American Memorial Park`.

The second data set is from Project 7, using the file:
`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/boundaries/cb_2018_us_state_20m.shp`
and excluding the data from Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico (this data set does not have any data from American Samoa, Guam, Virgin Islands).

Rename the column `STUSPS` from the second data set, and (instead) call this column `STATE`.

Now combine the data from these two data sets, keeping only the columns `STATE` and `geometry`.  You can use `pd.concat` with the option `ignore_index=True`.  Your resulting data frame should have 445 rows and 2 columns (396 rows from the first data set, and 49 rows from the second data set).

If your combined data set is called (for instance) by the name `myresults` then you can plot the boundarys (only) using:

myresults.boundary.plot()

In this way, you will be able to see the boundaries of the 48 continential states (plus the District of Columbia), and also will be able to see the boundaries of the national parks.

If the boundary lines look too thick, you can make the boundary lines thinner, for instance, like this:

myresults.boundary.plot(linewidth=0.2)

.Deliverables
====
- Display the boundaries of the 48 continential states (plus the District of Columbia), and also will be able to see the boundaries of the national parks.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Now revisit Question 3, but this time only show the boundaries of the parks from California, and also the boundary of the state of California.  You will see that California has one park whose boundaries poke into Nevada, and also some parks on islands.

.Deliverables
====
- Display the boundaries of the parks from California, and also the boundary of the state of California.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Go back to any of the 4 data sets from Questions 1, 3, 4, and make a plot of your own choosing, but instead of highlighting the maps according to the cities, this time (please) highlight something about the zip codes in the maps.

In the data from Question 1, the zip codes are stored in `Post_Code` and `ESRI_ZIP` and `DLGF_PRO_1` and `GEOZIP`.

(The data from Question 2 does not have zip codes.)

In the data from Question 3, the zip codes are stored in `PROP_ZIP` AND `DLGF_PRO_1` and `ESRI_ZIP`.

In the data from Question 4, the zip codes are stored in `PostCode_L` AND `PostCode_R` and `TIGER_ZIPL` and `TIGER_ZIPR` and `ESRI_ZIP` and `GEOZIPLEFT` and `GEOZIPRIGH`.

.Deliverables
====
- Make a map of your own choosing, highlighting something about the zip codes from 1 of the maps listed above, and using 1 of the zip code columns.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 5, using some comments and insights about your work.

== Submitting your Work

Please make sure that you added comments for each question, which explain your thinking about your method of solving each question.  Please also make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

Congratulations! Assuming you've completed all the above questions, you are learning to apply your web scraping knowledge effectively!

Prior to submitting your work, you need to put your work xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[into the project template], and re-run all of the code in your Jupyter notebook and make sure that the results of running that code is visible in your template.  Please check the xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[detailed instructions on how to ensure that your submission is formatted correctly]. To download your completed project, you can right-click on the file in the file explorer and click 'download'.

Once you upload your submission to Gradescope, make sure that everything appears as you would expect to ensure that you don't lose any points. We hope your first project with us went well, and we look forward to continuing to learn with you on future projects!!

.Items to submit
====

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
