= TDM 20200: Web Scraping Project 2 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** Now that we know how to use Beautiful Soup, we will learn comparable methods for web scraping with `lxml`.  This project will look very similar to the previous project.

**Context:** In this project, we will use `lxml`, documented here:  https://pypi.org/project/lxml/

**Scope:** Web Scraping in Python

.Learning Objectives:
****
- We learn the basics about web scraping using `lxml` in Python
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

In this project we will scrape data from the following websites:

- https://datamine.purdue.edu/about/about-welcome/
- https://www.nps.gov
- https://books.toscrape.com
- https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/
- https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/

Our scraping will be parallel to the examples from Project 1.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

When scraping data from websites using `lxml`, we again import `requests` but this time we also import from `lxml` like this:

[source, python]
----
import requests
from lxml import html
----

Afterwards, just like in the previous project, we can use `requests` to scrape the data from a website, such as (for instance) The Data Mine staff directory:

[source, python]
----
myresponse = requests.get("https://datamine.purdue.edu/about/about-welcome/")
----

and then we can parse this content using `html.fromstring` (which comes from `lxml`) like this:

[source, python]
----
mytree = html.fromstring(myresponse.content)
----

When selecting the parts of the webpage where we want to extract elements, this time we will use `xpath`.  The specification looks a lot like the way that we specify a location in BeautifulSoup, but there are a few differences.  We start the string for the location with `//` which indicates that we want to look in the entire document.  We also put an `@` symbol before each attribute.

We can extract the names of all 22 staff members at once, by selecting the data in `p` tags with `class` attribute `purdue-home-cta-grid__card-name` from the page.  Now that we are using `lxml` instead of Beautiful Soup, we change this statement:

[source, python]
----
mysoup.select('p[class = "purdue-home-cta-grid__card-name"]')
----

to INSTEAD using this statement:

[source, python]
----
mytree.xpath('//p[@class = "purdue-home-cta-grid__card-name"]')
----

which gives us the 22 elements we wanted to find.  Now, just like we did with Beautiful Soup, we can use a list comprehension to get these 22 names into a list.  Our previous statement from Beautiful Soup

[source, python]
----
[element.text for element in mysoup.select('p[class = "purdue-home-cta-grid__card-name"]')]
----

will INSTEAD look like this with `lxml`:

[source, python]
----
[element.text for element in mytree.xpath('//p[@class = "purdue-home-cta-grid__card-name"]')]
----

Now that you have the 22 staff members' names in a list, *use a similar operation* to extract the 22 staff members' job titles.

Finally, make a Pandas data frame with 22 rows and 2 columns, namely, 1 row per staff member, with their name in the left column and their job title in the right column.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should NOT import BeautifulSoup for this project.  We are using `lxml` instead, for this project.
====

.Deliverables
====
- Use `lxml` INSTEAD of Beautiful Soup to make a Pandas data frame with 22 rows and 2 columns, namely, 1 row per staff member, with their name in the left column and their job title in the right column.  *You should NOT import BeautifulSoup for this project.*
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.

The National Park Service homepage at https://www.nps.gov lists 56 states and territories.  Their names are given as the text after the `a` tags with `class` attribute `dropdown-item dropdown-state`.

Extract the 56 names of the states and territories, and remove the whitespace from the `text`, using the `strip()` function.

Now that you have these 56 names, we can get the locations of the webpages devoted to each state and territory, by extracting the `href` attribute from each tag.  If your data is stored in `element`, then the `href` attribute can be retrieved as `element['href']`.  Append the string `'https://www.nps.gov'` to the front of each string.

Finally, make a Pandas data frame with 56 rows and 2 columns, namely, 1 row per state or territory, with their name in the left column and a string displaying the URL for that state or territory in the right column.

For instance, the row for Indiana should have `'Indiana'` in the left column and `'https://www.nps.gov/state/in/index.htm'` in the right column.

The demo website Books To Scrape does not have real prices for books.  It is only a demonstration website, located at https://books.toscrape.com/

This website has numerous categories in the left-hand sidebar.  The names of the categories are given in a double set of `li` tags, and then an `li` tag, and then an `a` tag.  The names of the categories are the text after the `a` tags.

Extract the 50 category types as the text after the `a` tags, and remove the whitespace from the `text`, using the `strip()` function.  Hint:  `'Travel'` should be the first category, and `'Crime'` should be the last category.

Now that you have these 50 categories, we can get the locations of the webpages devoted to each category, by extracting the `href` attribute from each tag.  If your data is stored in `element`, then the `href` attribute can be retrieved as `element['href']`.  Append the string `'https://books.toscrape.com/'` to the front of each string.

(As a very minor point for sharp readers:  In question 2, we appended `'https://www.nps.gov'` without an additional forward slash, because in the NPS website, the slash was already in the `href` attribute.)

Finally, make a Pandas data frame with 50 rows and 2 columns, namely, 1 row per category, with their name in the left column and a string displaying the URL for that category in the right column.

For instance, the row for Poetry should have `'Poetry'` in the left column and `'https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/poetry_23/index.html'` in the right column.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Just like in Question 2, pleas be sure to make a data frame with 2 columns and (in this case) 50 rows, with 1 book topic and 1 book URL per line.

.Deliverables
====
- Use Python to make a Pandas data frame with 50 rows and 2 columns, namely, 1 row per category, with their name in the left column and a string displaying the URL for that category in the right column.

For *academic purposes only* now we extract a Snoopy comic from the internet.  As many students know, Dr Ward loves the Woodstock character from the Peanuts comic strip.  Although Woodstock first appeared on March 4, 1966, he was not named until June 22, 1970.  We can extract the comic from June 22, 1970, as follows:

Load the comic at this website:  https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1970/06/22

In Firefox, right click on the comic (or Control-click on a Mac), and "Inspect" the image in Firefox.  If we look into some of the html content for the picture, we will see:

[source, html]
----
<img class="img-fluid lazyloaded" srcset="https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47 900w" data-srcset="https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47 900w" sizes="
                       (min-width: 992px) 900px,
                       (min-width: 768px) 600px,
                       (min-width: 576px) 300px,
                       900px" width="100%" alt="Peanuts Comic Strip for June 22, 1970 " src="https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47">
----

In particular, if we look for an `img` tag with `alt` attribute that has value `'Peanuts Comic Strip for June 22, 1970 '` then we can extract the `src` attribute.  Hint:  It is necessary to put the space after the year in the string, on this website.

Verify that this URL contains the comic for the day that Woodstock got named:  https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47

Now load the Peanuts comic for two other days, and explain your steps.  In particular, specify which two other days you explored, and give the location of the comic image for those two days, just like for June 22, 1970, the comic image is located here: https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47

.Deliverables
====
- Verify that this URL contains the comic for the day that Woodstock got named:  https://assets.amuniversal.com/2181aa70f895013014ff001dd8b71c47
- For two additional days of your choice, give the days and the locations of the Peanuts comic image for those two days.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.

This website http://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/ has data about hockey teams, which students can use to practice scraping tables.

We can view 100 rows of this data at a time, for instance, as follows:  http://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/?page_num=4&per_page=100  which gives the 4th page of the data.  In other words, this page shows rows 301 through 400.

Indeed, there are only 582 rows altogether.  By asking for 582 or more rows at a time, in this particular website, we can actually get all 582 rows at once, like this:  https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/?per_page=600

(This is website dependent!  Not every website will allow you to do this.)

Now we can extract the entire table from this website.  First we need to import Pandas, and also `io` from `StringIO`:

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
----

Then, as in the previous two questions, we can extract the contents of the website as follows:

[source, python]
----
myresponse = requests.get("https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/?per_page=600")
mysoup = BeautifulSoup(myresponse.content, 'html.parser')
----

and then we can read the entire table, using `StringIO` and Pandas, as follows:

[source, python]
----
pd.read_html(StringIO(myresponse.text))[0]
----

which will show rows 0 through 4 and also rows 577 through 581.

.Deliverables
====
- Extract all 582 rows and 9 columns of the hockey data into a Pandas data frame.  Display rows 0 through 4 and also rows 577 through 581.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 5, using some comments and insights about your work.
