= TDM 40200: Project 06 - Data Types, Dependency and Mixed Model

== Project Objectives

**Motivation:** Learning the dependencies in the data and how to conduct more personalized models. 

**Context:** We will load `Lahman` data in R and will practice several linear models with the data.

**Scope:** Explore the use of mixed models in R, understand their advantages over simpler models, and interpret key results in a real-world context.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this project (and moving forward, when you are using R), please use the `seminar-r` kernel (not the `seminar` kernel), 
unless otherwise specified. When you use the `seminar-r` kernel with R, you do not need to use the `%%R` cell magic.

== Dataset
We will work with the Lahman Baseball Database, which is available in R through the `Lahman` package. 

In this project, we are transitioning from Python to R, and as an aspiring data scientist, it’s important to stay flexible and 
practice using different tools to keep your skills sharp. Switching between languages helps reinforce key concepts and 
prevents you from forgetting the details over time. Additionally, R offers powerful capabilities for the type of analysis we’re focusing on in this project.  
To access the `Lahman` dataset in R, you can use the following code. This isn’t calling a new function; it’s simply loading the `Lahman` data that comes with the package:

== Introduction


"All models are wrong, but some are useful."footnote:disclaimer[From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong[Wikipedia]: The phrase "all models are wrong" was first attributed to George Box in a 1976 paper published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. ]

`Lahman` is a comprehensive data set for sports analytics, including statistics from 1871 to 2023 with two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

More specifically, we will use the `Batting` table in `Lahman`, which includes batting statistics in the database. The main form of this table is *rectangular* or *raw*, which includes variables on columns and observations on rows. For example, *Homeruns (HR)* and *Runs Batted In (RBI)* are closely related to baseball statistics, but they are not identical. 


[NOTE]
====
Additional information for those who have no interest in baseball: The goal of baseball is for players to take turns hitting the ball and running to the four bases and scoring runs. If a player hits the ball and it goes out of bounds (into the stands), it is called a *Homerun (HR)*. In this case, that player and any runners on the field all score directly. In other words, more than one run can be scored with one hit. An *Runs Batted In (RBI)* is when a player hits a ball and enables their teammates to reach home plate and score. For example, if a player hits the ball and causes a teammate on the field to run, that player earns 1 RBI. A player who hits a homerun automatically gets 1 RBI for themselves. If there are other runners on the field at the time of the HR, the number of RBIs increases because they also scored. For example, an HR with two people on the field earns 3 RBIs in total.

Let's go back to the data set in R and remember the first steps we take when working with the data. 
We use the `head(Batting)` command to see the first six lines in the data. 
If you want to see some more details about `Lahman` data, type `?Lahman` and `?Batting`. 
Also, try the following `summary(Batting)` and `str(Batting)` for some main statistics and structure of each variable (column).


== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)
What are your first insights from the data so far?

Let's try to ask some interesting questions, such as "Have players been hitting more Homeruns (HR) over the years? Can you check it over a plot?"

[IMPORTANT]
====
When analyzing trends over time, it's important to consider rates rather than just raw counts. 
The total number of homeruns (HR) in a season can be influenced by many external factors, 
such as the number of games played, the number of players in the league, and how often they play. 
So, when analyzing sports statistics, always ask yourself: 

Is using raw counts appropriate, or should I adjust for playing time or other factors by using a rate? 
====

So, start calculating the HR rate (Homeruns per at-bat(AB)) and get a more meaningful measure of how often players hit home runs, 
independent of season length or other influences.  


Note: After you get your plot, you may notice some sharp decreases in HR rates, for example, in 1943. 
When you do a quick googling, you may see how World War II was effective on it.

Add one more question you find interesting from the data and write your own interpretation.

=== Question 2 (2 points)
Remember, HR guarantees at least one RBI since the batters score for themselves, and if there are runners on base, 
the RBI count increases. However, not all RBIs come from HRs; a batter can also earn RBIs through other types of hits, 
such as singles or doubles, that allow teammates to score. While power hitters who frequently hit HRs tend to have high RBI totals, 
their RBI count also depends on whether there are runners on base when they come up to bat.

As a result, examining the changes in these two variables individually and together can be important in understanding the hitting 
power of the players and their contributions to the team. 
Before looking at these changes, what you will notice in your initial analysis is that since not every player can hit HRs all the time, 
zero will be dominant in these vectors. Let's work with values greater than zero for these two variables.


.Deliverables
====
2.1. Generate a subset with the non-zero values of HR and RBI variables

2.2. Use a graph that shows how RBI and HR move together

2.3. What is the correlation between these two variables? *Remember:* Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables—in this case, how home runs (HR) and runs batted in (RBI) move together. If the correlation is strong and positive, it means that players who hit more home runs also tend to drive in more runs.
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

Consider a linear model where you aim to explain changes in the RBI with HR. How effective do you think a simple regression line is in capturing this variability?

Now, let's take a different approach. This time, we will run a separate linear model for each player. One way to achieve this is by using the `lmList` function from the `lme4` library as follows:

[source, R]
----
library(lme4)
model_each <- lmList(RBI ~ HR|playerID, data = Batting) 
summary(model_each)
----
The output of this model gives all parameter estimates for some players, while for others, it gives `NaN` or `NA` values. 
There may be different reasons for this. Before reading the next paragraph, pause for a while and think about what can cause it.

image::Think.png[]

One of the reasons can be that some players might not have enough data points to estimate both the slope (HR coefficient) and intercept. 
If a player has only one data point, then the regression line is undefined because there is no variation in HR to estimate a slope. 
If a player has exactly two data points, the regression line is perfectly determined, meaning the standard error cannot be estimated, 
which can result in `NaN`. 

Additionally, if a player's HR values do not vary at all, the model cannot compute a meaningful slope, leading to `NA` values for the coefficient. In cases where RBI and HR have a perfect linear relationship, the regression model may achieve a perfect fit, resulting in undefined or extremely large standard errors. Finally, missing data in either HR or RBI can cause certain players to have too few valid observations, preventing proper coefficient estimation and leading to `NA` or `NaN` values in the results.

After running this model, if you run the

library(nlme)
plot(intervals(model))

function below, you will get the following graph showing the intercept and slope coefficients of each player and their respective confidence intervals:

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in Gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
