= TDM 40200: Project 06 - Data Types, Dependency and Mixed Model

== Project Objectives

**Motivation:** Learning the dependencies in the data and how to conduct more personalized models. 

"All models are wrong, but some are useful."footnote:disclaimer[From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong[Wikipedia]: The phrase "all models are wrong" was first attributed to George Box in a 1976 paper published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. ]

**Context:** We will load `Lahman` data in R and will practice several linear models with the data.

**Scope:** Explore the use of mixed models in R, understand their advantages over simpler models, and interpret key results in a real-world context.

.Learning Objectives
****
•	Exploratory data analysis and visualization
•	The significance of subject-specific parameters in models
•	Storytelling with your data
•	Mixed models

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this project (and moving forward, when you are using R), please use the `seminar-r` kernel (not the `seminar` kernel), unless otherwise specified. When you use the `seminar-r` kernel with R, you do not need to use the `%%R` cell magic.

== Introduction

`Lahman` is a comprehensive data set for sports analytics, including statistics from 1871 to 2023 with two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

More specifically, we will use the `Batting` table, which includes batting statistics in the database. The main form of this table is *rectangular* or *raw*, which includes variables on columns and observations on rows. For example, *Homeruns (HR)* and *Runs Batted In (RBI)* are closely related to baseball statistics, but they are not identical. 


[NOTE]
====
Additional information for those who have no interest in baseball: The goal of baseball is for players to take turns hitting the ball and running to the four bases and scoring runs. If a player hits the ball and it goes out of bounds (into the stands), it is called a *Homerun (HR)*. In this case, that player and any runners on the field all score directly. In other words, more than one run can be scored with one hit. An *Runs Batted In (RBI)* is when a player hits a ball and enables their teammates to reach home plate and score. For example, if a player hits the ball and causes a teammate on the field to run, that player earns 1 RBI. A player who hits a homerun automatically gets 1 RBI for themselves. If there are other runners on the field at the time of the HR, the number of RBIs increases because they also scored. For example, an HR with two people on the field earns 3 RBIs in total.

Let's go back to the data set. Remember what we do first with the data. We use the `head(Batting)` command to see the first six lines in the data. Also, if you want to see some more details about Lahman, use `?Lahman` and `?Batting`. Also, try the following `summary(Batting)` for some main statistics for each variable.



== Dataset
In this project, we are working with the Lahman Baseball Database, which is available in R through the `Lahman` package. This week, we are transitioning from Python to R, and as an aspiring data scientist, it’s important to stay flexible and practice using different tools to keep your skills sharp. Switching between languages helps reinforce key concepts and prevents you from forgetting the details over time. Additionally, R offers powerful capabilities for the type of analysis we’re focusing on in this project.  
To access the `Lahman` dataset in R, you can use the following code. This isn’t calling a new function; it’s simply loading the `Lahman` data that comes with the package:

== Submitting your Work

Once you have completed the questions, save your Jupyter notebook. You can then download the notebook and submit it to Gradescope.

.Items to submit
====
- firstname_lastname_project6.ipynb

[WARNING]
====
You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in Gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
