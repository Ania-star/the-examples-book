= TDM 20200: Mapping:  Project 8 -- Spring 2025

**Motivation:** We continue to learn how to plot maps in Python.

**Context:** We will focus on maps of Tippecanoe County.

**Scope:** Mapping

.Learning Objectives:
****
- We continue to learn how to make maps in Python
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about project submissions xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

In this project we will use the following mapping data:

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/tippecanoe/`

== Questions

Load Pandas as Geopandas as follows:

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
----

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Review the examples from Project 7, Questions 3, 4, 5, where we learned how to put colors into a map.

Read the map data for Tippecanoe County addresses into a variable called `mydata` as follows:

[source, python]
----
mydata = gpd.read_file('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/tippecanoe/AddressPoints.shp')
----

Using `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` you will have the ability to see all of the columns.

Display the head of `mydata`.

What is the shape of `mydata` (i.e., how many rows and columns are there)?

Create a new column called `mycolors`, which you should make `'orange'` by default.

For all of the rows in which the `GEOCITY` column is equal to `'WEST LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'green'`.

For all of the rows in which the `GEOCITY` column is equal to `'LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'purple'`.

Plot all of the boundaries in `mydata` using the orange, green, and purple colors that you just created, as follows:  `mydata.plot(color = mydata['mycolors'])`

.Deliverables
====
- Display the head of `mydata`.
- Give the shape of `mydata` (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
- Plot all of the boundaries in `mydata` using orange, green, and purple colors, as specified above.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 1, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

Read the map data for Tippecanoe County boundaries into a variable called `mydata` as follows:

[source, python]
----
mydata = gpd.read_file('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/tippecanoe/Boundaries.shp')
----

Display the head of `mydata`.

What is the shape of `mydata` (i.e., how many rows and columns are there)?  Notice that this data set is much smaller than the AddressPoints data from Question 1.

Notice that there is only 1 row in `mydata` that has `Shape_Area` bigger than 1 billion.  In other words, if we create mymysteryDF = mydata[mydata['Shape_Area'] > 1000000000] then `mymysteryDF` is a data frame with just 1 row and 14 columns.  Plot the region from `mymysteryDF`.

.Deliverables
====
- Display the head of `mydata`.
- Give the shape of `mydata` (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
- Plot the boundary of the 1 shape which has `'Shape_Area'` larger than 1 billion.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 2, using some comments and insights about your work.
====

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

Read the map data for Tippecanoe County parcels into a variable called `mydata` as follows:

[source, python]
----
mydata = gpd.read_file('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/tippecanoe/Parcels.shp')
----

Display the head of `mydata`.

What is the shape of `mydata` (i.e., how many rows and columns are there)?

This data looks really beautiful in its natural state.  Go ahead and plot the data from the file first, before making any modifications.

After you plot the data in its natural blue condition, then (just like we did in Question 1) make a new column called `mycolors`, which you should make `'orange'` by default.

For all of the rows in which the `PROP_CITY` column is equal to `'WEST LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'green'`.

For all of the rows in which the `PROP_CITY` column is equal to `'LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'purple'`.

Plot all of the boundaries in `mydata` using the orange, green, and purple colors that you just created, as follows:  `mydata.plot(color = mydata['mycolors'])`

.Deliverables
====
- Display the head of `mydata`.
- Give the shape of `mydata` (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
- First plot the data in its natural blue condition.
- Afterwards, plot the data again, but this time, displaying `mydata` using orange, green, and purple colors, as specified above.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 3, using some comments and insights about your work.
====


=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Read the map data for Tippecanoe County parcels into a variable called `mydata` as follows:

[source, python]
----
mydata = gpd.read_file('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/tippecanoe/StreetCenterlines.shp')
----

Display the head of `mydata`.

What is the shape of `mydata` (i.e., how many rows and columns are there)?

Just like we did in Question 1, make a new column called `mycolors`, which you should make `'orange'` by default.

For all of the rows in which the `GEOCITYRIG` column is equal to `'WEST LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'green'`.

For all of the rows in which the `GEOCITYRIG` column is equal to `'LAFAYETTE'`, change the value of `mycolors` to `'purple'`.

Plot all of the roads in `mydata` using the orange, green, and purple colors that you just created, as follows:  `mydata.plot(color = mydata['mycolors'])`

.Deliverables
====
- Display the head of `mydata`.
- Give the shape of `mydata` (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
- Plot `mydata` using orange, green, and purple colors, as specified above.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 4, using some comments and insights about your work.

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Go back to any of the 4 data sets from Questions 1, 3, 4, and make a plot of your own choosing, but instead of highlighting the maps according to the cities, this time (please) highlight something about the zip codes in the maps.

In the data from Question 1, the zip codes are stored in `Post_Code` and `ESRI_ZIP` and `DLGF_PRO_1` and `GEOZIP`.

(The data from Question 2 does not have zip codes.)

In the data from Question 3, the zip codes are stored in `PROP_ZIP` AND `DLGF_PRO_1` and `ESRI_ZIP`.

In the data from Question 4, the zip codes are stored in `PostCode_L` AND `PostCode_R` and `TIGER_ZIPL` and `TIGER_ZIPR` and `ESRI_ZIP` and `GEOZIPLEFT` and `GEOZIPRIGH`.

.Deliverables
====
- Make a map of your own choosing, highlighting something about the zip codes from 1 of the maps listed above, and using 1 of the zip code columns.
- Be sure to document your work from Question 5, using some comments and insights about your work.

== Submitting your Work

Please make sure that you added comments for each question, which explain your thinking about your method of solving each question.  Please also make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

Congratulations! Assuming you've completed all the above questions, you are learning to apply your web scraping knowledge effectively!

Prior to submitting your work, you need to put your work xref:ROOT:templates.adoc[into the project template], and re-run all of the code in your Jupyter notebook and make sure that the results of running that code is visible in your template.  Please check the xref:ROOT:submissions.adoc[detailed instructions on how to ensure that your submission is formatted correctly]. To download your completed project, you can right-click on the file in the file explorer and click 'download'.

Once you upload your submission to Gradescope, make sure that everything appears as you would expect to ensure that you don't lose any points. We hope your first project with us went well, and we look forward to continuing to learn with you on future projects!!

.Items to submit
====

[WARNING]
====
It is necessary to document your work, with comments about each solution.  All of your work needs to be your own work, with citations to any source that you used.  Please make sure that your work is your own work, and that any outside sources (people, internet pages, generating AI, etc.) are cited properly in the project template.

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output even though it may not.

**Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or if it does not render properly in Gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
