Question 1.

During which pair of years did the level of Lake Huron rise the most?
The data to use is from the built-in `LakeHuron` data set.
(E.g., during 1875 to 1876, Lake Huron rose 1.48 feet.)  It might help to use the `diff` command.

Question 2.

a. What is the average duration of an eruption in the `geyser` dataset in the `MASS` library?

b. What were the 10 longest durations?

c. How many durations were 3 minutes or longer?
(You do not need to install the `MASS` library; it is installed already.  You do, however, need to load the `MASS` library.)

Question 3.

a.  Which car(s) in the `mtcars` data set had the highest gas mileage?

b.  Which car(s) had the highest horsepower?

c.  Which car(s) had the shortest (i.e., fastest) 1/4 mile time?

d.  How many cars had manual transmission?

e.  How many cars had manual transmission and also six cylinders?

Question 4.

a.   Which states are (strictly) larger in population than Indiana but (strictly) smaller in population than Pennsylvania, according to the data in the `state` data set?
Hint: You can get the state populations using `state.x77[,"Population"]`.

b.   Which states are (strictly) larger in land area than Indiana but (strictly) smaller in land area than Pennsylvania, according to the data in the `state` data set, as listed in `state.x77[,"Area"]`?

Question 5.

If `Z` is a standard normal random variable, we know that `Z` has average 0 and variance 1.  Use `R` to simulate:

a. the value of the average of `|Z|`, and

b. the value of the variance of `|Z|`.

Here, `|Z|` is just the absolute value of `Z`.

Question 6.

Write a function called:  `countas` that takes a sequence of words and returns the number of words that have 1 or more `a`s. For instance, `countas(  c("ate", "hello", "duolingo", "pat", "aa")  )` should return the value 3.  Hint:  It might help to use the `grep` function.

Question 7.

a.  Write a function called:  `firstthree` that returns the location of the first occurrence of 3 in a vector.  For instance, `firstthree( c(-2.5,3,3,0.001,22,5,7,19,3,17) )` should return the value 2.

b.  Write a function called:  `thirdthree` that returns the location of the third occurrence of 3 in a vector.  Ffor instance, `thirdthree( c(-2.5,3,3,0.001,22,5,7,19,3,17) )` should return the value 9.

Question 8.

Write a function called:  `topfive` that returns the most common five values in a vector, along with the counts for each of the 5 values.

Question 9.

a. Euler's number is 2.718281828459...  Euler's number is defined as `1 + 1/1 + 1/(1*2) + 1/(1*2*3) + 1/(1*2*3*4) + 1/(1*2*3*4*5) + ...` Find a good way to calculate this in `R`, with few keystrokes. If you subtract 2.718281828459 from your estimate, you should get something very small, e.g., roughly `4.5 * 10^{-14}.`

b.  Find a good way to approximate the value of Pi, using only the fact that `Pi^2 / 6 = 1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 + 1/5^2 + 1/6^2 + 1/7^2 + ....`

Question 10.

a. The triangular numbers are: `1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...` See http://oeis.org/A000217 Find an efficient way to compute, in `R`, the first 100 such numbers.  Does your method extend to the first 1000 such numbers too?

b. The tetrahedral numbers are: `1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, ...` See: http://oeis.org/A000292 Find an efficient way to compute, in `R`, the first 100 such numbers.  Does your method extend to the first 1000 such numbers too?
