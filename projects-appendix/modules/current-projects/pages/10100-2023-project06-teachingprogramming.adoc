= TDM 10100: Project 6 -- Fall 2023
Tapply, Tapply, Tapply

**Motivation:** We want to have fun and get used to the function `tapply`


Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].
 
== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (1.5 pts)

(We do not need the tapply function for Question 1.)

For this question, you will use a data frame read from the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv`, you may name the data frame  `myDF`
[source, r]

myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/olympics/athlete_events.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE )

Review the data frame by R commands: _head,table,length,uique, etc._ Answer following questions
[loweralpha]
.. Use table function to list all Games with occurences in this data frame 
.. use table functionlist all countries participating in the Olympics in year 1980 (output should exclude country that did not have any athelet attended) 
.. You may create a new subset data frame for althelet that attended olympic more than one time by 
[source, r]
altheletGamesDF <- myDF[duplicated(myDF$ID) | duplicated(myDF$ID, fromLast = TRUE), c("ID", "Name", "NOC", "Games")]


    next, please use order() function to permutate data frame altheletGamesDF order by county, Games and ID, replace altheletGamesDF with ordered records. 


=== Question 2 (1.5 pts)


[loweralpha]
.. What is the average age of participants from different country?
.. What is Maximum Height by Sport? list top 5 of Height
+
[TIP]
====
- You may get warning message 
[source, r]
“no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf”

it dues to for some group all "height' values are missing and max function returns '-Inf'
- You may use sort function to get top 5 Height
[source, r]
sort(...)[1:5]

 
.. Which city/cities hosted Olympic more than one time?

 
=== Question 3 (1.5 pts)

For this question, you will use a data frame read from dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv` 
[source, r]
myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/death_records/DeathRecords.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

Reviwe the data frame structure by str() function str(myDF)
[loweralpha]
.. What is the number of observations(rows) for this dataframe?
.. Change the column "MonthOfDeath" from numbers to months
.. How many people died in total on each month?


=== Question 4 (2 pts)


[loweralpha]
.. What is the average age of different Maritial Status at death?
.. What is the number of Females who are married? Divorced? Widowed? Single?  Now find the analogous numbers for Males.
.. Now solve both questions from 4b at one time, i.e., use one command to find the number of Females who are married, divorced, widowed, or single, and the number of Males in each of these four categories.  You can compute all eight numbers with just one `tapply` command.

=== FIVE

[loweralpha]
.. Using the two data sets create two separate graphs or plots on the data that you find interesting (one graph or plot for each of the two data sets in this project).  Write 1-2 sentences on each one and why you found it interesting/what you noticed in the dataset.
