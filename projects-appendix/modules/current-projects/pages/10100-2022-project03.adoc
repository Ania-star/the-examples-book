= TDM 10100: Project 3 -- Fall 2022
Inroduction to R part II

In xref:programming-languges:R:introduction[R] a *data frame* is the primary data structure. It is important to understand how to insert, retrieve, and update data in a *data frames*. 

.Insider Knowlege 
[%collapsible]
====
A *data frame* is a table or a 2D array. Each column containes values or a variable.  Each row contains one set of values for each column. 
====
**Context:** In the previous project we ran our first R code. Learned about accessing data within vectors. +
In this project we will continue to reinforce what we've already learned and introduce a new, flexible data structure called `data.frame`s.

**Scope:** r, data.frames, recycling, factors

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain what "recycling" is in R and predict behavior of provided statements.
- Explain and demonstrate how R handles missing data: NA, NaN, NULL, etc.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order,  length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- List the differences between lists, vectors, factors, and data.frames, and when to use each.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].


Using the *f2022-s2023-r* kernel 
Lets first see all of the files that are in the Disney folder 
[source,r]
----
list.files(path = "/anvil/projects/tdm/data/disney", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE,
           full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE,
           ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, no.. = FALSE)
----

After looking at several of the files we will go ahead and read in the data frame on the 7 Dwarfs Train.
[source,r]
----
myDF <- read.csv("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/disney/7_dwarfs_train.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
----

If we want to see the file size (aka how large) of the CSV. 
[source,r]
----
file.info("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/disney/7_dwarfs_train.csv")$size
----
You can also use 'file.info' to see other information about the file. 

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
*size*- double: File size in bytes. +
isdir- logical: Is the file a directory? +
*mode*- integer of class "octmode". The file permissions, printed in octal, for example 644. +
*mtime, ctime, atime*- integer of class "POSIXct": file modification, ‘last status change’ and last access times. +
*uid*- integer: the user ID of the file's owner. +
*gid*- integer: the group ID of the file's group. +
*uname*- character: uid interpreted as a user name.
grname +
character: gid interpreted as a group name. Unknown user and group names will be NA.

=== ONE

Familiarizing yourself with the data. 

.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]
====
You can look at the first 6 rows (`head`) and the last 6 rows (`tail`). The structure (`str`) and/or the dimentions (`dim`) of the dataset. +

*"SACTMIN"* is the actual minuites that a person waited in line +
*"SPOSTMIN"* is the time above the ride estimating the wait time. (Any value that is -999 means that the ride was not in service) +
*"datetime"* is the date and time the information was recorded +
*"date"* is the date of the event 
====

Print the first 11 rows of the data.frame, and take a look at the columns. Based on that, write 1-2 sentences describing the dataset (how many rows, how many columns, the type of data, etc.) and what it holds.

=== TWO

Now that we have a better understanding of content and structure of our data. We are diving a bit deeper and making connections within the data.

[loweralpha]
.. If we are looking at the column *"SPOSTMIN"* what do you notice about the incraments of time?
.. How many different wait time options do you see?
.. How many NA values do you see in *"SACTMIN"*. 
.. Create a new data frame with the name newDF that has the deletion of missing (NA) values.

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
`na.omit` and `na.exclude` returns objects with the ovservations removed if they contain any missing values. As well as performs calculations by considering the NA values but does not include them in the calculation. +
`na.rm` first [.underline]#removes the NA values and then# does the calculation. +
`na.pass` returns the object unchanged

.Helpful Hint

Use the code below 
[source,r]

table(myDF['SPOSTMIN'])

==== FOUR
Recyling in R  +

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
Recycling happens in R automatically.When you are teempting to preform operations like addition, subtraction on two vectors of unequal length. +
The shorter vector will be repeated as long as the operation is completeing on the longer vector. 
====

[lowercase alpha]
.. What is the length of *"SACTMIN"*
.. Remove all of the NA values in *"SACTMIN"* and create a new data frame named `newDF`. Find its length.
.. Now divide each data frame `myDF` and `newDF` by 60 and create a new data frame named `myresults`. What is the length of that `myresults`?
.. What happened in row 7636?
