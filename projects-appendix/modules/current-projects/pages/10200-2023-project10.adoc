= TDM 10200: Project 10 -- Spring 2023


**Motivation:** Being able to create accurate and telling visualizations is a skill that we can develop. Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is an invaluable tool. 

**Context:** We are going to take a bit of a pause and work on learning some ways to create visualizations. Examine some plots, write about them, and then use your creative minds to create visualizations about the data. 


**Scope:** python, visualizing data

Python has several packages that help with creating data visualizations. Listed below are some of the most popular packages, these include (but are not limited to) 
* Matplotlib: a 2-D plotting library
    * Works with NumPy arrays and allows for a large number of plots to help easier understand trends and make correlations. It is *not* ideal for time series data
* Plotly: allows for the creation of easy to understand interactive plots.
    * Has 40 unique chart and plot types, but is not beginner friendly 
* GGplot: One of the more popular in the Python library It maps data and allows for attributes to be changed including color, shape, and even geometric objects. 
    * Can store data in a dataframe, you can build informative visualizations because of the different ways you can represent the data. 
* Pygal: Allows the download of visualizations into different formats. Can be used to create an interactive experience. 
    * It can become slow if it has too large of number of data points, but it allows users to still create wonderful visualizations even in complex problems.
* Geoplotlib: Buildable maps and plot geographical data using this library. It is able to use large datasets.
    * Has the ability to create various maps, including dot maps, heat maps, area maps, and point density maps.
