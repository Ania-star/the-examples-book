= TDM 20200: Project 2 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Web scraping is is the process of taking content off of the internet. Typically this goes hand-in-hand with parsing or processing the data. Depending on the task at hand, web scraping can be incredibly simple. With that being said, it can quickly become difficult. Typically, students find web scraping fun and empowering.

**Context:** In the previous project we gently introduced basic webpage contents and BeautifulSoup concepts. In this project, we will learn about real world web scraping, scrape data from an real website 

**Scope:** Python, requests, web scraping, BeautifulSoup

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use the requests package to scrape a web page.
- Use the lxml package to filter and parse data from a scraped web page.

.. Review the source code for the "The Example book" and provide the following information
... Copy and paste the `header` element that is 1 level nested in the `main` element into a markdown cell in an HTML code block. Include _just_ the tag with the attributes -- don't include the elements nested within the `header` element.
