= TDM 10200: Project 10 -- Spring 2024

**Motivation:** Being able to create accurate and telling visualizations is a skill that we can develop. Being able to analyze and create good visualizations is an invaluable tool. 

**Context:** We are going to take a bit of a pause and work on learning some ways to create visualizations. Examine some plots, write about them, and then use your creative minds to create visualizations about the data. 


**Scope:** python, visualizing data, matplotlib
