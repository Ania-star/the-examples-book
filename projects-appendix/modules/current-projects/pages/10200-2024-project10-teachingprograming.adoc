= TDM 10200: Project 10 -- Spring 2024

**Motivation:** NumPy is the foundation that Pandas is built on. Mastering NumPy's numerical operations will enrich your understanding for numerical operations and data analysis.

**Context:** Hopeful you have found yourself understand well on Python foundation and pandas introductions. In this project we will delve into NumPy, understand its role in supporting and enhancing pandas functionalities. 

**Scope:** Python, pandas, NumPy

== Dataset

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/2014.csv`

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 2 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 10 this week.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. The dataset is 2.5 G. For this project, we will only need the following columns, so let us create a DataFrame with only those columns with corresponding data types.

[source,python]
----
cols = [
    'DepDelay', 'ArrDelay', 'Distance', 
    'CarrierDelay', 'WeatherDelay', 
    'DepTime', 'ArrTime', 'Diverted', 'AirTime'
]

col_types = {
    'DepDelay': 'float64', 
    'ArrDelay': 'float64', 
    'Distance': 'float64', 
    'CarrierDelay': 'float64', 
    'WeatherDelay': 'float64', 
    'DepTime': 'float64', 
    'ArrTime': 'float64', 
    'Diverted': 'int64', 
    'AirTime': 'float64'
}
----
[TIP]
====
- You may refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html[pandas.read_csv] to know more about read only specific columns
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)
.. Use 'to_numpy()' to create a numpy array for column 'DepDelay'
.. Display the array's shape and data type
.. Use 'nan_to_num()' to replace all null value in the array to 0
.. Add 15 minutes to all departure delay time and use numpy 'mean()' to calculate and display the average for the updated Departure Delay

[NOTE]
====
- Sample output result like

.output
----
Average Departure Delay after added 15 minutes: 25.417677824932802
----
====
=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Create a numpy array for column 'ArrDelay'
.. Replace all null value to 0
.. Calculate and display the maximum arrival delay and min arrival delay

[NOTE]
====
- Sample output result like

.output
----
Max Arrival Delay: 2444.0 minutes 
Min Arrival Delay: -112.0 minutes
----
====


=== Question 4 ( 2 points)

Now let us compare the time we need to do calculation by pandas vs. numpy, solve the following 2 questions with pandas methods only
.. Create a array named "delayed_flights" to hold flights with either "departure delay > 60 minutes or arrival delay > 60 minutes"
.. Calculate the average distance for these flights
.. how long does the program take to get the average?

[TIP]
====
- You may import time() library to calculate the time spent like
[source,python]
----
import time
start_time = time.time()
#your program here
....
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Used time is {start_time - end_time}")
----
====

=== Question 5 (2 points)

Please using 'numpy' methods to Calculate the average distance for question 4 
.. Create numpy arrays for 'DepDelay','ArrDelay' and 'Distance' separately
.. Create a boolean array the hold the condition that 'departure delay > 60 minutes or arrival delay > 60 minutes'
.. Use the condition from 5b to filter the numpy array for 'Distance' to get only Distances that satisfy the condition 
.. Use numpy 'mean()' to calculate the average distance for those flights
.. How long does the program take to get the average?
.. Please state your understanding of pandas vs. numpy from Question 4 and 5
