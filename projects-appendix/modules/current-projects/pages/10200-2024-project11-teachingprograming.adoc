== Dataset

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/2014.csv`

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 2 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 10 this week.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions

=== Question 1(2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Create a class named "Flight" , it contains attributes for flight_number, origin airport ID, destination airport ID,  departure time, arrival time, delays 
.. Add a function get_delay() to the class to get the delay time

=== Question 2(2 points)
.. Create a DataFrame named "myDF", get data from provided dataset for only following columns and 100 rows
.. Load data from myDF to the Flight class instances, you should have a list of 100 Flight instances 

=== Question 3(2 points)
.. Create a dictionary variable named "delays_dest" as an empty dictionary
.. Use a for loop to assign values to "delays_dest" from flight objects 
.. Calculate the average arrival delay time for each station and save the result to a dictionary named "average_delays"

=== Question 4(2 points)
.. Create a function called arr_avg_delays based on the steps from Question 3, it has input as Flight objects and output a dictionary of average delays for each destination
.. Run the function using 100 Flight instances from Question 2 as input

=== Question 5(2 points) 
.. Add a function get_depDelay() to the class
.. Create a function called dep_avg_delays, take Flight objects as input, calculate average departure delays for each station an return the delays information
.. Run the function for the 100 Flight objects
