= TDM 10200: Project 9 -- Spring 2024


**Motivation:** Working with pandas can be fun! Learning how to manipulate and clean up data in pandas is a helpful tool to have in your tool belt! In this project, we will introduce another python library - NumPy library. NumPy is a library for linear algebra in python. It is a crucial foundation for many python data science libraries built above it. 

**Context:** Now that we are feeling more comfortable with building functions and using pandas. We are now expanding our toolkit to include NumPy. NumPy's numerical and linear algebra abilities along with pandas will allow us to continue build skills and solve data driven problems.

**Scope:** python, pandas, numpy

== Datasets

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/weather.csv
 

== Questions 

=== Question 1 ( 2 points )

 
[loweralpha]
 
.. Use pandas to read the file and use the following attributes or methods to describe the data frame
... .head()
... .shape
... .dtypes
... .info()
... .describe()

=== Question 2 ( 2 points)

.. Use method `value_counts()` to get numbers of records for each station
.. Use method `groupby()` to get numbers of records for each station 
.. Explain the difference between using the two methods
 

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Find out how many null records exist in 'myDF' for each column
+
[TIP]
====
- `isnull()` is useful to find null records
====
.. Count total number of nulls across 'myDF'
+
[TIP]
====
- sum() is useful
====
.. Drop rows with any null values across 'myDF', saved the output to a new DataFrame 'myDF_cleaned'. display the total count of non-null records in the new DataFrame
+
[TIP]
====
- `dropna()` is useful
====
.. From question 3a, use the column's average values of each specific column to replace the null values, save the output to a new DataFrame 'myDF_filled'. display the total count of non-null records in the new DataFrame
[TIP]
====
- `fillna` is useful
====





.. Combine column "latitude" and "longitude" to create a new column "location" for each station

[TIP]
====
- You may refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.combine_first.html[pandas.DataFrame.combine_first function]
====

=== Question 4 ( 2 points)

 .. create a function to calculation average heat index by the following formula for the station and date specified
 HI = 0.5*(T+61.0+((T-68.0)*1.2 )+(R*0.094))


=== Question 5 ( 2 points)
..
