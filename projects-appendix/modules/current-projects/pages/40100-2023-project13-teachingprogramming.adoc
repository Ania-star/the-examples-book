= TDM 40100: Project 13 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Containers are everywhere and a very popular method of packaging an application with all of the requisite dependencies. This project we will learn some basics of containerization in a virtual environment using Alpine Linus. We first will start a virtual machine at anvil, then create a simple container in the virtual machine. You may find more information about container and relationship between virtual machine and container https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container [here]

**Context:** The project is to provide very foundational knowledge about containers and virtualization,focusing on theoretical understanding and basic system interactions. 

**Scope:** Python, containers, UNIX

.Learning Objectives
****
- Improve your mental model of what a container is and why it is useful.
- Use UNIX tools to effectively create a container.
****

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Questions

=== Question 1 (1 pt)

[loweralpha]

.. Logon to anvil and use a bash command to find an available port you may use later. Just need to list 1 available port number 
 
[TIP]
====
- You may use the following code to find port from range 1025 to 65535, please edit if needed or run you own code
- You may use a loop to do it for you instead of manually try one by one
[source, bash]
if timeout 2 bash -c ">&/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/1025" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Port used"
else
    echo "Port available"
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

.. Launch a virtual machine (VM) on Anvil with Docker pre-installed. Submit the output of job id and process id after you start a virtual machine like
.output
[1] 3152048

[NOTE]
====
The most popular containerization tool at the time of writing is likely Docker. We will Launch a virtual machine on Anvil with Docker pre-installed

First thing is first. Open up a terminal on Anvil. You may do it from within Jupyter Lab, run the following code to ensure that SLURM environment variables don't alter or effect our SLURM job 

[source,bash]
----
for i in $(env | awk -F= '/SLURM/ {print $1}'); do unset $i; done;
----

Next, let's make a copy of a pre-made operating system image. This image has Alpine Linux and a few basic tools installed, including: nano, vim, emacs, and Docker. 

[source,bash]
----
cp /anvil/projects/tdm/apps/qemu/images/builder.qcow2 $SCRATCH
----

Next, we want to acquire enough resources (CPU and memory) to not have to worry about something not working. To do this we will use SLURM to launch a job with 4 cores and about 8GB of memory.

[source,bash]
----
salloc -A cis220051 -p shared -n 4 -c 1 -t 04:00:00
----

Next, we need to make `qemu` available to our shell. Open a terminal and run the following code

[source,bash]
----
module load qemu
# check the module loaded
module list
----

Next, let's launch our virtual machine with about 8GB of memory and 4 cores. Replace the "[port]" with port number you got from question 1

[source,bash]
----
qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc none,ipv4 -hda $SCRATCH/builder.qcow2 -m 8G -smp 4 -enable-kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::[port]-:22 &
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
- [port] need to be replaced with your port number
====

Next, its time to connect to our virtual machine. We will use `ssh` to do this.

[source,bash]
----
ssh -p [port] tdm@localhost -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
----

If the command fails, try waiting a minute and rerunning the command -- it may take a minute for the virtual machine to boot up.

When prompted for a password, enter `purdue`. Your username is `tdm` and password is `purdue`.

Finally, now that you have a shell in your virtual machine, you can do anything you want! You have superuser permissions within your virtual machine! 
For this question, submit a screenshot showing the output of `hostname` from within your virtual machine!

====


=== Question 3 (1 pt)

.. Exploring the virtual machine File System. Navigate the Alpine Linux file system and list the contents of the root directory.
.. List all running processes in the system 
.. Display network configuration and test network connectivity.
[TIP]
====
- You may refer to the following sample code or create your own ones

[source, bash] 
ls / # list all root files

[source, bash]
ps aux # system running processes

[source,bash]
ifconfig # network interface configuration

====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)
.. Write and execute a simple shell script to display a message, like

[TIP]
====
[source, bash]
echo 'echo Hello Your name , You are the Best!!!' > hello.sh

- run the shell script

chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
====

 
=== Question 5 (2 pts)

After you complete previous questions, you can see you can use the virtual machine just like your own computer. Now let us follow the following step to use Docker within the virtual machine to create and manage a container. Run all the commands in your terminal, copy the output to your jupyter notebook cells.

.. List the docker version inside the virtual machine
[source, bash]
docker --version

.. Pull teh "hello-world" image from Docker Hub
[source, bash]
docker pull hello-world
..Run a container based on the "hello-world" image
[source, bash]
docker run hello-world
+
[NOTE]
====
When the command runs, docker will create a container from the 'hello-world' image and run it. The container will display a message confirming Docker installation is ok, then exit.
====

.. List the container(s) with following command, it will provide you all the containers that currently running or exited already 
[source, bash]
docker ps -a

.. After you confirm the container ran successfully, you may using following command to remove it
[source, bash]
docker rm [Container_id]
[TIP]
====
Replace [Container_id] with id you got from previous question 
====
