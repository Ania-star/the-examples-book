= TDM 10200: Project 6 -- 2024
**Motivation:** Once we have some data analysis working in Python, we often want to wrap it into a function.  Dr Ward usually tests anything that he wrote (usually 5 times), to make sure it works, before wrapping it into a function.  Once we are sure our analysis works, if we wrap it into a function, it can usually be easier to use.


**Context:**  Functions also help us to put our work into bite-size pieces that are easier to understand.  The basic idea is similar to functions from R or from other languages and tools. 

**Scope:** functions

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Create a list to hold all files from 1986 to 2018, display the list
.. Create a function to read a dataframe from a input file, the function inputs will be a file path as string, a column title as list which has a default value set for election files, returns will be year as integer and a DataFrame
+
[TIP]
====
- You may refer to the following title list for the dataset, you may need to update it for some datasets as needed
[source, python]
t_list=["CMTE_ID","AMNDT_IND","RPT_TP","TRANSACTION_PGI","IMAGE_NUM","TRANSACTION_TP","NAME","CITY","STATE","ZIP_CODE","EMPLOYER","OCCUPATION","TRANSACTION_DT","TRANSACTION_AMT","OTHER_ID","TRAN_ID","FILE_NUM","MEMO_CD","MEMO_TEXT","SUB_ID"]
====

==== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a function to calculate the unique committees numbers for different years. Display the year and committees. Use function from 1b as helper function 
.. Run the function for year 2004 to 2010

==== Question 3 (2 points)

.. Create a function to find the top 5 states by total amount of "TRANSACTION_AMT" for specified dataset(s) 
.. Run the function for dataset for year 1984 "itcont1984.txt"
.. Run the function for datasets from 2008 to 2014

[TIP]
====
- Pay attention to the type of data in the `TRANSACTION_AMT` column.  You might need to convert this column to decimal numbers before making calculations.
- You may use the `sorted()` function to sort the dictionary items that contain the `state` and `total transaction amount` pairs.
- Refer to https://realpython.com/sort-python-dictionary[Python sorted function]. You may need to define a helper function inside the main function, and pass it to `sorted()` as a callback function. The following is an example to get a tuple extracted from dictionary as a `(state, amount)` pair.  You may modify this example to fit your approach.

[source,python]
----
def get_trans_amt(state_amt_tuple):
    return state_amt_tuple[1]

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Create a function to find out what are top 5 employers by total transaction amount for specified datasets?
.. Run the function for the 1984 dataset.
.. Run the function for the datasets from 1990 to 1994.

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Create one of your own function using the dataset under the folder, use at least two of following: packing/unpacking(list), helper function and/or callback function
