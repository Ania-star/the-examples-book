= TDM 10200: Project 4 -- 2023

**Motivation:** In the last project we spent time using if statements and for loops, today we are going to take a step back and learn more about loops. There are three main types of loops. `for loops, while loops, and nested loops`. We will also talk about tuples and lists. 
We will also learn about one of the most useful data structures in Python a dictionary commonly referred to as *`dict`*.


**Context:** This is our second project and we will continue to introduce some basic data types and go thru some similar control flow concepts like we did in `R`. 

**Scope:** tuples, lists, loops, dict

=== ONE

A `dict` contains a collection of key value pairs
[source,python]
----
NFL_team = dict([
            ('Indiana', 'Colts')
            ('Kansas City', 'Chiefs')
            ('Philadelphia', 'Eagles')
            ('Minnesota', 'Vikings')
            ('New England', 'Patriots')
            ('Miami', 'Dolphins')
])
print(NFL_team)
#output of code
{'Indiana': 'Colts', 'Kansas City': 'Chiefs', 'Philadelphia': 'Eagles', 'Minnesota': 'Vikings', 'New England': 'Patriots', 'Miami': 'Dolphins'}
----

There are two primary ways to retrieve information from a `dict`. 

* df.get()
* df[]


[loweralpha]
.. Create a dictionary of MLB teams for the American League, call it `MLB_teams`
.. Now add to the current `dict` `MLB_teams` the National League.
.. Delete all the teams that are South of Tennessee and North Carolina. (Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.)

Loops are important in any programming language as they help to execute code repeatedly. +

While Loop- helps execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 

It looks a bit like this:
[source, python]
----
count = 0
while (count <15):
    count = count + 2
    print ("Yay!")
----

You can also pair a 'else statement' with a 'while loop'. The else statement will ONLY be executed when the while condition is false. 
[source, python]
----
while condition"
    # executes specific statments
else:
    # execute specific statments
----
 
[loweralpha]
.. Using the code below add an else statement that will print "Boo!" after any number greater than 15
[source, python]
----
count = 0
while (count <15):
    count = count + 2
    print ("Yay!")
----
.. Use the while loop to print a number series to 200 by 10's 

.. Put the phrase "Old McDonald had a farm e-i-e-o" into a string and call it `words` and print the result to return everything *EXCEPT* the letter *a* 

.. Now take `word' and replace the symbol *-* with an asterisk ***

For Loops- are typically used  for going thru a list, array, or a string. Typically it runs a specific code over and over again "for" a defined number of times in a sequence. The 'while loops' runs until it hits a certain condition, the 'for loop' iterates over items within a sequence or list.

[source, python]

====
-The first word of the statement is `for` which identifies that it is the beginning of the `for loop`. +
- The `iterator variable` is a variable that changes each time the loop is executed. +
- The keyword `in` shows the iterator variable which elements to loop over in a sequence. +
- The statements allow you to preform various functions
====
.Helpful Hint
[%collapsible]
====
- *enumerate()* The function enumerate() allows us to iterate thru a sequence but it keeps track of the index and element. It can also be converted into a list of tuples using the 'list()' function. +
[source, python]
----
#create list of fruit
fruit = ['cherry', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'apple']
#enumerate fruit but start at number one since default is 0
num_fruit = enumerate(fruit, start=1) 
#print the enumerate object as a list
print (list(num_fruit))
#output from code
[(1, 'cherry'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'orange'), (4, 'kiwi'), (5, 'apple')]
----
- *range()* The function is built into python that allows for iteration through a sequence of numbers.`range()` will never include the stop number in its result (aka 6) and always include 0 +
[source,python]
----
range(6)
for n in range(6):
    print(n)
#output from code
0
1

Notice that the indexing for our dataframe starts at 0. In `python` and other programming languages the indexing starts at 0. Whereas our previous semester in `R` the indexing began at 1. This is an important fact to remember.

From the dataset `cars` create a dict called my_dict that contains key:value pairs. The keys should be the years and the values are a single integer representing the number of vehicles from that year. 

[loweralpha]
.. Print years 
.. Find the last five rows of the data frame
.. Find how many rows and columns there are in the entire dataframe
.. Print just the column names

Now that we have a bit of familiarity with the data, lets introduce another common `python` package called 'matplotlib'
Let create a graphic using this package.

*Matplotlib* is a data visualization and plotting library for`Python`. Its an easy way to generate visual data plots. 
[WARNING]
====

You _must_ double check your `.ipynb` after submitting it in gradescope. A _very_ common mistake is to assume that your `.ipynb` file has been rendered properly and contains your code, markdown, and code output, when in fact it does not. **Please** take the time to double check your work. See https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/submissions[here] for instructions on how to double check this.

You **will not** receive full credit if your `.ipynb` file does not contain all of the information you expect it to, or it does not render properly in gradescope. Please ask a TA if you need help with this.
====

A `.ipynb` file is generated by first running every cell in the notebook, and then clicking the "Download" button from menu:File[Download].

In addition to the `.ipynb`, if a project uses Python code., you will need to also submit a Python script. A Python script is just a text file with the extension `.py`.

Let's practice.  take the Python code from this project and copy and paste it into a text file with the `.py` extension. Call it `firstname-lastname-project01.py`. Download your `.ipynb` file -- making sure that the output from all of your code is present and in the notebook (the `.ipynb` file will also be referred to as "your notebook" or "Jupyter notebook").

Once complete, submit your notebook,and Python script.
