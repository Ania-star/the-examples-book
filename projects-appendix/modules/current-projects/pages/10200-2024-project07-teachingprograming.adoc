= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas allows us to work with data frames.  The actions that we perform on data frames will sometimes remind us of similar actions that we have performed on data frames during the previous semester with R.  For instance, we often want to extract information about one or more variables, sometimes grouping the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Unifying our understanding of Pandas and the ability to develop functions will allow us to systematically analyze data.

**Scope:** Pandas and functions
