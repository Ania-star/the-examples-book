= TDM 20100: Project 6 -- 2023

**Motivation:** `awk` is a programming language designed for text processing. It can be a quick and efficient way to quickly parse through and process textual data. While Python and R definitely have their place in the data science world, it can be extremely satisfying to perform an operation extremely quickly using something like `awk`. 

**Context:** This is the second of three projects where we introduce `awk`. `awk` is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of the tasks that we've previously used other UNIX utilities for. After this project, we will continue to utilize all of the utilities, and bash scripts, to perform tasks in a repeatable manner.

**Scope:** awk, UNIX utilities

.Learning Objectives
****
- Use awk to process and manipulate textual data.
- Use piping and redirection within the terminal to pass around data between utilities.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`
- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/observations.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 (1 pt)

[loweralpha]

.. How many columns and rows are in the following dataset: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`.

The following is example output
.output
----
rows: 12345
columns: 12345
----

=== Question 2 (1 pt)

[loweralpha]

.. Please list all possible "Location Type " of the orders in the file of `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`. The list need to have each location type followed by the numbers of orders. Use `awk` to answer this question. Make sure to format the output as follows

.output
----
Location Type       Number of Orders
--------------      ----------------
AAA                 12345
bb                  99999
----

=== Question 3 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]

.. What is year range for the orders created at  in the dataset: `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`?
 
[TIP]
====
The https://thomas-cokelaer.info/blog/2011/05/awk-the-substr-command-to-select-a-substring/[`substr`] function in `awk` will be useful.

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. How much is the summary of order amount for each year in data set `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/restaurant/orders.csv`?

Pease make sure the output format as follows

.output
----
Year  Summary of Orders in dollars
2019 $1234.56
2020 $9999.99
----

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Please list the months and average `wind_speed_average` for the months in the file `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/whin/observations.csv`. The output should be in order
