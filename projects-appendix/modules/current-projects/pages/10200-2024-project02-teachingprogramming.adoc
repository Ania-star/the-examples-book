= TDM 10200: Project 2 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas will enable us to work with data in Python (in a similar way to the data frames that we learned in R in the fall semester). Matplotlib is a widely-used Python library for creating visualizations in Python.

**Context:** This is our second project and we will continue to introduce some basic data types, basic operations using pandas and matplotlib

**Scope:** tuples, lists, pandas, matplotlib

.Learning Objectives
****
- Familiar with python data types

== Dataset(s)

You will use the following dataset(s) for questions

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv`

== Questions

=== Question 1 ( 2 points) 

 
[loweralpha]
.. Create a data set named 'data' that contains 6 student first names, ages and majors
.. Take the data you created and make it into a dataframe named `studentDF`
.. Now change the index numbers 0-6 to student's first names

 
=== Question 2 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame called `myDF`.
.. Find the last five rows of the data frame
.. Find how many rows and columns there are in the entire dataframe
.. Print just the column names

=== Question 3 ( 2 points )

[loweralpha]
.. How many vehicles price over $6000 are on this list?
.. How many vehicles from IN vs from TX 
.. How many regions have vehicles listed in the data frame?

=== Question 4 (2 points)
