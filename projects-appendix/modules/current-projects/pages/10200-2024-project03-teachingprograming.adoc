= TDM 10200: Project 3 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Learning about Big Data. When working with large data sets, it is important to know how we can use control flow to find our information, a little bit at a time, without reading in all of the files at once. Control flow is the order that your code runs
 

**Scope:** Python, Control Flow, if statements, for loops

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts) 

[loweralpha]

.. Explore the files in the provided data set directory. Find out how many years are included in the data set. Briefly describe the contents of the files.
.. Import the library `pandas` as `pd`, and import `Path` from `pathlib`.
.. Create a list named `myfiles`, to hold `Path` objects from `1980.csv` to `1983.csv` in the data set folder using `list comprehension`. You can start with the following sample code (below), but *you need to modify this for loop*, to use `list comprehension`.  
+
[TIP]
====
Following is the sample code that will return a "Path" object for the file `1750.csv`.
[source,python]
Path("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/1750.csv")

You can start with a for loop, to create a list of Path objects, as follows, BUT we want you to modify this example, to use `list comprehension`.
[source,python]
myfiles=[]
for year in range (1980, 1984):
    file= Path(f'/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/{year}.csv')
    myfiles.append(file)
print(myfiles)
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

.. Calculate how many records are in the file `1980.csv`.  (Each line is one record.)
+
[TIP]
====
The following is the sample code to calculate records in one sample file object named `file`:
[source, python]
with open(file,"r") as f:
    mycount = 0
    for line in f:
        mycount += 1
print(f'There are {mycount} records in the file called {file}')

There are 33923709 records in the file called /anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/1980.csv
====
.. Calculate how many records there are (altogether) in the 4 files from `1980.csv` to `1983.csv`.  Use the list `myfiles` that you created in Question 1.  Your output should give the total number of records altogether, so it should say something like:

There are [put your number of records here] records in the 4 files altogether.

[TIP]
====
- You may use a for loop to iterate over the `myfiles` object, like this:
[source,python]
for file in myfiles:
    ...# body of the for loop
====


=== Question 3 (2 pts)

.. Run the following statement, to read in the first file from the list `myfiles` into a DataFrame. Display the column names for `myDF`. Look at the head and tail of `myDF`. Do you see anything unexpected?
+
[source,python]
----
myDF = pd.read.csv(myfiles[0])
----
.. Please modify your work from Question 3a, to correct the problem that you found. What are the column names now?
+
[TIP]
====
The `header=None` argument will be useful 
====
.. Now let us add these 7 column names: `id`, `date`, `element_code`, `value`, `mflag`, `qflag`, `sflag`, and `obstime` to the data frame.
+
[source,python]
----
pd.read_csv(myfiles[0],names = ["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"])
----
.. Make a list called `mydataframes` (of length 4) that contains 4 data frames, one for each year, from `1980.csv` to `1983.csv`. Starting with the sample code (above) for reading in the first file, modify our example, so that you have a "for" loop that reads in all 4 files.  Test your work with another `for` loop, which displays the column names of each of the four data frames in `mydataframes`.

[TIP]
====
The following example code shows how to find the column names for `file`. You can embed this code into a "for" loop, to show the column names of all 4 data frames. (Their names should be identical.)
[source,python]

column_names = file_df.columns
print(column_names)
====

=== Question 4 (2 pts)

Let's look at the column `element_code`. Use a loop to solve the following questions for all 4 DataFrames:

.. Print out the (unique) elements of the column `element_code` (i.e., show each element just one time).
.. Find the number of times that `SNOW` occurs in the `element_code` column.

[TIP]
====
- The method `unique()` will be useful to calculate unique values.
- You may use different methods to find the number of times that `SNOW` occurs, for instance, `len()`, `value_counts()`, `sum()`, etc.
====
 

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Now let us practice using the `chunksize` feature for big data. You may refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-load-a-massive-file-as-small-chunks-in-pandas/[this document], to get more informaiton about `chunksize`.

.. Try to run the following 2 programs, to find the number of times that `SNOW` occurs in the `element_code` column, from the year 1980 to year 1983. Explain your understanding of `chunksize`.

Pre-work for the programs:

[source, python]
----
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
myfiles=[]
for year in range (1980, 1984):
    file= Path(f'/anvil/projects/tdm/data/noaa/{year}.csv')
    myfiles.append(file)
----

Version 1 of the program:

[source, python]
----
count = 0
for file in myfiles:
    for myDF in pd.read_csv(file,names=["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"],chunksize =10000):
        count += len(myDF[myDF['element_code'] == 'SNOW'])

print(count)
----

Version 2 of the program:

[source,python]
----
count = 0
for file in myfiles:
    for myDF in pd.read_csv(file,names=["id","date","element_code","value","mflag","qflag","sflag","obstime"],chunksize =10000):
        for index, row in myDF.iterrows():
            if row['element_code'] == 'SNOW':
                count += 1
print(count)
----
