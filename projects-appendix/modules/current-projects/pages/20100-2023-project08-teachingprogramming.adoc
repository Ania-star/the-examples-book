= TDM 20100: Project 8 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for querying and manipulating data in a database. SQL can handle much larger amounts of data than R and Python can alone. SQL is incredibly powerful. Learning SQL is well worth your time!

**Context:** There are a multitude of RDBMSs (relational database management systems). Among the most popular are: MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and SQLite. As we've spent much of this semester in the terminal, we will start in the terminal using SQLite.

**Scope:** SQL, SQlite

.Learning Objectives
****
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a database 
- Describe basic database concepts like: RDBMS, tables, fields, query, join, clause.
- Basic clauses: select, limit, where, from, etc.

== Dataset(s)

For this project, we will be using the `lahman` sqlite database. This database contains the data in the directory  

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman`

You may get some more `lahman` database information from this youtube video http://youtube.com/watch?v=tS_-oTbsDzs
[2023 SABR Analytics:Sean Lahman, "introduction to Baseball Databases"]

To run SQL queries in a Jupyter Lab notebook, first run the following in a cell at the top of your notebook to establish a connection with the database.

[source,ipython]
----
%sql sqlite:////anvil/projects/tdm/data/lahman/lahman.db
----

For every following cell where you want to run a SQL query, prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- just like we do for R or bash cells.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts)

Get started by taking a look at the available tables in the database. What tables are available?

[TIP]
====
You'll want to prepend `%%sql` to the top of the cell -- it should be the very first line of the cell (no comments or _anything_ else before it).

[source,ipython]
----
%%sql

-- Query here
----
 
In SQLite, you can show the tables using the following query:

[source, sql]
----
.tables
----

Unfortunately, SQLite-specific functions can't be run in a Jupyter Lab cell like that. Instead, we need to use a different query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
----
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. It's always a good idea to get an idea what your table(s) looks like. A good way to do this is to get the first 5 rows of data from the table. Write and run 6 queries that return the first 5 rows of data of each table.

.. To get a better idea of the size of the data, you can use the `count` clause to get the number of rows in each table. Write an run 6 queries that returns the number of rows in each table.

[TIP]
====
Run each query in a separate cell, and remember to limit the query to return only 5 rows each.

You can use the `limit` clause to limit the number of rows returned.
====

=== Question 3 (1 pt)

Okay, let's dig into the `people` table a little bit. Run the following query.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 5;
----

As you can see, every row has a `playerID` for each player. It is an unique identifier or key for the `people` table. As in Question 2, you checked several tables, you might already notice that a few tables contain this `playerID` such as in table `Batting`, `Fielding`,`Managers` etc., it relates data from those tables to the specific player.
[loweralpha]
.. Let us find information about a famous baseball player `Mike Trout` from the `people` table

[TIP]
====
The `WHERE` clause can be used to filter the results of a query.
Use table fields `nameLast` and `nameFirst` for the query
====


=== Question 4 ( pt)

Now you understand what the `playerID` means _inside_ the database. Let's use the `playID` from output of Question 3 for Mike Trout to find out how many home runs he did  

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM Batting where playerID ='troutmi01'
----

The query will output all fields of data for Mike Trout from table `Batting`
[loweralpha]
.. Please update the query to only display the result for year `2022` with information of playerID, teamID and home run times 

[TIP]
====
`HR` field contains home run information for players
==== 

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

Now let us find your favorite baseball player's information from the database if their data exists in the database. If not, change to someone else that you may find them in the database.

[loweralpha]

.. Please find your favorite baseball player's information from `people` table
.. Please use the playerID to get the player's home run times in year 2022
.. Please join table `people` and table `Batting` to display information of the fields of `Last Name, first Name, weight, height, birthYear,home run time for year 2022, teamID, Year`

[TIP]
====
You may refer to the following website for SQLite table join examples   https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-join/ 

Use `yearID` from `Batting` table for Year
