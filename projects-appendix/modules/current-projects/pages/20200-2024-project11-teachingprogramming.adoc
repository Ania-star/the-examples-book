= TDM 20200: Project 11 -- 2024
 
**Motivation:** Machine learning and AI are huge buzzwords in industry, in this project, we will continue to know more TensorFlow features    

**Context:** The purpose of these projects is to give you exposure to machine learning tools, some basic functionality, and to show _why_ they are useful, without needing any special math or statistics background

**Scope:** Python,tensorflow, scikit-learn

[WARNING]
====
You need to use 2 cores for your Jupyter Lab session for Project 11 this week.
====
[TIP]
====
You can use `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` if you want to see all of the columns in a very wide data frame.

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. At previous project, we created a model to predict arrival delays with dataset of "2014.csv", now let us import the dataset of year 2019 mimic it as real data to calculate the predicted arrival delays. Just import the same columns and 10,000 rows 

..  Use "model.predict()" to predict arrival delays for the dataset of year 2019 

[source, python]
----
cols = [
    'DepDelay', 'ArrDelay', 'Distance',
    'CarrierDelay', 'WeatherDelay',
    'DepTime', 'ArrTime', 'Diverted', 'AirTime'
]
----
 
 
=== Question 2 (2 points)


.. Now let us compare the model's performance on the 2019 year dataset. Calculate the MSE and MAE values

 
=== Question 3 ( 2 points)

.. Now let look into the value of MSE and MAE. Please describe and analysis the meaning of the values 
.. Based on the values of your output, what do you think about your model performance 

=== Question 4 ( 2 points)

.. Now if your model performs not good at the 2019 dataset. Let use do some adjustment on the original model to input more rows as 100,000 rows
.. Redo Question 1-3 

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Based on the results from previous questions. Please state what is your solution to improve your model's performance
