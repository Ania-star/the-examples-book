= TDM 20200: Project 5 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Dash is a web application framework. It can create web based visualization, provide a simple way to create interactive user interfaces. Dash uses Plotly for its plotting capabilities. It can build interactive dashboards for data visualization. 

**Context:** Create good visualizations about housing data using "plotly", "Dash"

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly, Dash, DashBoards, Visual Studio Code
