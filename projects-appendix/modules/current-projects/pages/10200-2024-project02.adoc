= TDM 10200: Project 2 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Pandas will enable us to work with data in Python (in a similar way to the data frames that we learned in R in the fall semester). Matplotlib is a widely-used Python library for creating visualizations in Python.

**Context:** This is our second project and we will continue to introduce some basic data types, basic operations using pandas and matplotlib

**Scope:** tuples, lists, pandas, matplotlib

.Learning Objectives
****
- Familiar with python data types
- Basic panda operations
- Basic matplotlib operations
****

== Dataset(s)

You will use the following dataset(s) for questions

- `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv`

== Readings and Resources

* Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

* Please review the following Examples Book Contents  
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/tuples [Python tuples]
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/lists [Python lists]
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/pandas-dataframes [Python pandas DataFrames] 
- https://the-examples-book.com/programming-languages/python/matplotlib [matplotlib]

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 pts) 

[loweralpha]
.. Create a list of tuples with 6 elements, each tuple represents one student with first name, age and major. Assign the list to a variable named 'data'. You may make up the students' information
.. Use the data you created to create a DataFrame named `studentDF`
.. Use "iloc[]" to extract and display the second student information in the DataFrame

[TIP]
====
You may get more information about "iloc[]" https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_iloc.asp[here] 
====

=== Question 2 (2 pts)
.. Display the index of the studentDF as a list
.. Now change the index numbers from the default numeric 0-6 to student's first name for studentDF, and display the index as a list to certain it changes to "first name"

[TIP]
====
* You may need to use "inplace" argument to set it to 'True' to update the existing DataFrame's index instead to create a new DataFrame with new index
====

 
=== Question 3 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]

.. Read in the dataset `/anvil/projects/tdm/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv` into a `pandas` DataFrame called "mydf", use first column "id" as DataFrame's index
.. Display the first and last five rows of the myDF DataFrame
.. Display how many rows and columns there are in the entire DataFrame
.. Display a list of all the column names in the DataFrame

[TIP]
====
[source,python]
----
.head()
.tail()
.shape

====

=== Question 4 ( 2 pts )

[loweralpha]
.. How many vehicles price over $6000 excluded are on this list?
.. How many vehicles from Indiana vs from Texas
.. Display all regions that has vehicles listed in the data frame. How many regions?

=== Question 5 (2 pts)

[loweralpha]
.. Plot a bar chart to illustrate the number of vehicles that price lower than $6000 excluded in different states
