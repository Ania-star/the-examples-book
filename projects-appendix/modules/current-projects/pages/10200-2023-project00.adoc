= TDM 10200: Project 7 -- 2023

**Motivation:** Pandas allows us to work with data frames.  The actions that we perform on data frames will sometimes remind us of similar actions that we have performed on data frames during the previous semester with R.  For instance, we often want to extract information about one or more variables, sometimes grouping the data according to one variable and summarizing another variable within each of those groups.

**Context:**  Unifying our understanding of Pandas and the ability to develop functions will allow us to systematically analyze data.

**Scope:** Pandas and functions

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset/


== Questions

=== ONE

Create a new data frame called `myDF` that contains all of the data for Indianapolis from the `csv` files from the directory:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/flights/subset`

These files correspond to the years 1987 through 2008.  Your data frame should contain all of the data for all of the flights with `IND` as the `Origin` or `Dest` airport.

=== FOUR


Consider flights departing from "IND".  If we group by the airline (UniqueCarrier), and take an average of the departure delays, what are the average departure delays for each of these three airlines: `AA`, `DL`, and `UA`?

=== FIVE

Wrap your work from Question 1 and 2a into a function that accepts an `Origin` airport (as the departing airport), and outputs the 10 most popular destination airports.

Test your function on several airports, e.g., test it on each of these three airports (one at a time) `IND`, `ORD`, `CVG`, to make sure that the output from the function makes sense.
