= TDM 10100: Project 11 -- 2022
Application 

**Motivation:** Selecting the right tools, understanding a problem and knowing what is available to support you takes practice. +
So far this semester we have learned multiple tools to use in `R` to help solve a problem. This project will be an opportunity for you to choose the tools and decide how to solve the problem presented. 

We will also be looking at `Time Series` data. This is a way to study the change of one or more variables through time. Data visualizations help greatly in looking at Time Series data. 


Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):
