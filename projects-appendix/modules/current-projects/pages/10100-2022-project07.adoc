= TDM 10100: Project 7 -- 2022
Subset and Merge 

**Motivation:** Learning a few of the most basic and fundemental functions in *`R`* is `subset` and `merge`. 

**Scope:** r, subset, merge

.Learning Objectives
****
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order, length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Demonstrate how to use tapply to solve data-driven problems.

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv

== Questions

=== ONE
Data can be hosted on different servers and exisit in various files. Since data can come from multiple sources it is important to know how to merge data so that you can see the entirety of what you will be working with. +
Linking data.frames can be done *horizontally* or *vertically*.

====
*Horizontally* - combines dataframes horizontally meaning that it adds variables (aka columns) to an already exisiting dataframe. It does this according to a shared ID field. In short you can keep the number of rows but add more columns. Be aware that you need to make sure to watch the number of rows and the order of rows. If either the number or the order is off in the data.frames you are trying to merge is off, then your pairing may not make sense. `cbind()` +

*Vertically* - combines data.frames vertically, meaning that both have the same variables (aka columns) but the number of observations (aka rows) are not the same. The rows will stacked together when merged. This is helpful when you have multiple datasets that have the `same set of columns` and you can just add more rows. `rbind()`

.. Read in the csv files and name them: +
    * titles <- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv +
    * episodes <- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv +
    * people <- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv +
    * ratings <- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv +
.. Taking a look at `titles` what are the different genres listed?
.. Looking at the `years` column and the `genres` column. In which year did the most comedy's debut?

*merge()* function in `R` allows two data frames to be combined by common columns. This function allows the user to preform similar functions as found in the database *SQL* joins.
