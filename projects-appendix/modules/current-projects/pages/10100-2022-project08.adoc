= TDM 10100: Project 8 -- 2022

**Motivation:** Functions, they are an important part of writing effecient code. +
Functions allow us to repeat and reuse coding steps. If you find you using a code repeadely, a function may be a good way to reduce your lines of code!

**Context:** We've been learning about and using functions these last few weeks. +
To learn how to write your own functions we need to learn some of the terminology and components.  

**Scope:** r, functions

.Learning Objectives
****
- Gain proficiency using split, merge, and subset.
- Demonstrate the ability to use the following functions to solve data-driven problem(s): mean, var, table, cut, paste, rep, seq, sort, order, length, unique, etc.
- Read and write basic (csv) data.
- Explain and demonstrate: positional, named, and logical indexing.
- Demonstrate how to use tapply to solve data-driven problems.
- Comprehend what a function is, and the components of a function in R.
****

== Dataset(s)

We will use the same dataset(s) as last week:
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv
/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv


.Helpful Hints
[%collapsible]
====
`fread`- is a fast and efficient way to read in data.

[source,r]
----
library(data.table)

titles <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/titles.csv"))
episodes <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/episodes.csv"))
people <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/people.csv"))
ratings <- data.frame(fread("/anvil/projects/tdm/data/movies_and_tv/ratings.csv"))

== Questions

Writing our own function to make a repetitive operation easier by turning it into a single command. +

Take care to name the function somthing concise but meaningful so that others can understand what the function can be understood by other users. +

Functions can also be called formal arguments. 

.Insider Knowledge
[%collapsible]
====
A function is an object that contains multiple interrelated statments put together in a predefined order when called(run). +

Functions can be built-in or created by the user (user-defined). +

.Some examples of built in functions are: 

* min(), max(), mean(), median()
* print()
* head()

Syntax of a function
[source, R]
----
what_you_name_the_function <- function (argument) {
  statement(s) that are executed when the function runs
}

=== ONE
To gain a better insight into our data lets make two simple plots
- A grouped bar chart showing each typ eof genre in each year
- A line plot  to see if there is any change over time in a genre (you pick)

=== TWO
For practice, now that you have a basic understanding of how to make a function, we will use that knowlege in our dataset(s)

Here are pieces of a function we will use on this dataset put them in the correct order then run the function. +

  - remove_the <- function(titles) {

  }
