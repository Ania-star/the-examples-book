== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]

.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], launch VS Code on Anvil
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], including the Initial Configuration of VS Code, and install the Python extension for Visual Studio
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], select the Python interpreter path to `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3`
.. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.  Show the current path for the Python interpreter.

[TIP]
====
For Question 1a, follow the sections of "How can I launch VS Code on Anvil?" Choose the following options:

    - Allocation: "cis220051"
    - CPU Cores: 1
    - Starting Directory: "Home Directory"

If you get "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder" window pop up, click "Yes, I trust the authors"
====

[TIP]
====
Refer to the "Initial Configuration of VS Code" section to install the Python extension

Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting[Code Editing in Visual Studio Code] to see how to edit and run code

Use the following command to find the path for the Python interpreter.

[source,python]
----
which python3
----
.output
/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a python file in Visual Studio Code, name it "helloWorld.py", simply to create and display a greeting sentence 
.. Run the file through terminal 

[TIP]
====
The following command may be used to run a python file:

[source,python]
python3 helloWorld.py
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

.. After you setup `Visual Studio Code`, create a simple flask application with only define a Flask instance name it 'app'
+
[TIP]
====
- You may need to import Flask class before use it
[source,python]
----
app=Flask(__name__)
----
- Refer to the following arguments to run the app
[source,python]
----
app.run(host='0.0.0.0',post=8050,debug=True)
----
====

.. Run the python file through the terminal


[NOTE]
====
- A popup window will show "Your application running on port 8050 is available...", click the "Open in Browser" button to open a browser
====

=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. You should get a 404 page - "Not Found page" for your question 3 since you have not defined route for home page yet.Now update the code to add a route for home page 
+
[TIP]
====
- Use a decorator for the home ("/") route,followed by a function you like to run. It is ok you may just output a greeting message like

[source,python]
----
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
----
====
.. Run the python file through terminal

=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. You should get  your message at webpage for Question 4. Now let us separate to add a html file instead of put content message inside the python file. Create a folder named 'templates' where your python file located, then create a simple html file named "index.html" in the folder to hold the greeting message or you may create a fancy html page

.. Update your python file root decorator to render the information to webpage from 'index.html'
+
[TIP]
====
- flask's function "render_template" is useful, you can import it by the following statement
[source,python]
----
from flask import render_template
----
====
.. Run the python file
