= TDM 20200: Project 7 -- 2024

**Motivation:** Dash is a web application framework. It can create web based visualizations.  It provides a simple way to create interactive user interfaces and dashboards for data visualization. Dash uses Plotly for its plotting capabilities.

**Context:** Create good data visualizations using `plotly` and `Dash`

**Scope:** Python, visualizations, plotly, Dash, DashBoards, Visual Studio Code

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create a development environment to building a dashboard on Anvil 
- Develop skills and techniques to create a dashboard using `plotly`, `dash`, `Visual Studio Code`
****

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset:

`/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv`


== Readings and Resources

[NOTE]

== Questions

=== Question 1 (2 points)

[loweralpha]
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], launch VS Code on Anvil
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], including the Initial Configuration of VS Code, and install the Python extension for Visual Studio
.. Following the instructions on https://the-examples-book.com/starter-guides/tools-and-standards/vscode[Visual Studio Code Starter Guide], select the Python interpreter path to `/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3`
.. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.  Show the current path for the Python interpreter.

[TIP]
====
For Question 1a, follow the sections of "How can I launch VS Code on Anvil?" Choose the following options:

    - Allocation: "cis220051"
    - CPU Cores: 1
    - Starting Directory: "Home Directory"

If you get "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder" window pop up, click "Yes, I trust the authors"
====

[TIP]
====
Refer to the "Initial Configuration of VS Code" section to install the Python extension

Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/codeediting[Code Editing in Visual Studio Code] to see how to edit and run code

Use the following command to find the path for the Python interpreter.

[source,python]
----
which python3
----
.output
/anvil/projects/tdm/apps/lmodbin/python-seminar/python3
====

=== Question 2 (2 points)

.. Create a python file in Visual Studio Code, name it "who_am_I.py", simply to create and display a paragraph of your self-introduction that you may use it at a job interview 
.. Run the file through terminal 

[TIP]
====
The following command may be used to run a python file:

[source,python]
python3 who_am_I.py
====

=== Question 3 (2 points)

[NOTE]
====
After you setup `Visual Studio Code`, we can use it to create our Dash app. Since we will run our code on Anvil, obviously it will not run at the root path or root url ("http://ondemand.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu").  Instead, we will need to create a Prefix Path that nests the Dash app under it.  Use the provided code to assemble the Prefix Path.

[source,python]
----
import subprocess
import requests
import lxml.html
import socket
import os
import psutil
import yaml
from dash import Dash, html,dcc
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# get the hostname
hostname= subprocess.run("hostname", text=True, capture_output=True).stdout.strip()
 
def is_open(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) != 0

def find_port(start_port, end_port):
    for port in range(start_port, end_port):
        if is_open(port):
            return port
    raise RuntimeError("No open port found")

# Use this function to find an open port
port = find_port(8050, 65535)

vscode_port = yaml.unsafe_load(open(f"/proc/{psutil.Process(psutil.Process(psutil.Process(psutil.Process(os.getpid()).ppid()).ppid()).ppid()).ppid()}/cwd/connection.yml", 'r').read()).get("port")

# assemble prefix
prefix = f"/rnode/{hostname}/{vscode_port}/proxy/{port}/"
----
====
.. Display the prefix string you assembled


=== Question 4 (2 points)

.. Now create a Dash app to display your self-introduction online (anvil local hosted webpage)

[TIP]
====
Read the https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial["dash tutorial"].  Make sure that you understand the basic components to create a Dash App.  

You will need to add an additional "requests_pathname_prefix" parameter to `Dash`, in order to specify the URL prefix that the Dash app uses for all its requests. Refer to the following code.  Modify it if needed:

[source, python]
Dash(__name__,request_pathname_prefix = prefix)

You will need to start the app with "port" parameters.  You may refer to the following code, and modify it if needed:

[source, python]
app.run(port=port)

You may start the app with an additional "host" parameter, with default value as '0.0.0.0', if you would like to reach the website through a network interface.

[source, python]
app.run(host = '0.0.0.0',port=port)
====
 
=== Question 5 (2 points)

.. Now please create a dash app to do Project 6 question 2d: "make a bar chart to visualize the top 5 regions with the oldest inventory of homes (on average, in those regions)".

[TIP]
====
Read about https://dash.plotly.com/layout["Dash Layout"], to understand the basic Dash app layout.

If you get output that says "Killed" from the program, it might be because the size of dataset is too large. You can either use more cores, or you can use chunksize to read in the dataset iteratively.

[source,python]
pd.read_csv('/anvil/projects/tdm/data/zillow/Metro_time_series.csv',chunksize=10000)

If you choose to use chunksize, then use a for loop to read chunks of the DataFrame and calculate the aggregate values each chunk, and then combine and find the top 5 for the whole dataset.

(It is likely easier to just use more cores for the project.
