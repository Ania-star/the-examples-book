= 300/400 Seminar Homework Submission Steps

All of the homeworks are in a Jupyter notebook and contain the instructions and links to materials needed to be successful for that homework. Each week we will release a folder that contains the notebook (as well as supplementary data or images). The general process to retrieve and work on homeworks is:

1. Copy the homework from a read only location on Anvil once per week
2. Work on the homework
3. Submit to Gradescope before the deadline

== 1. Copy The Homework

The homeworks are stored in the directory `/anvil/projects/tdm/seminar/`. There is a folder for each corresponding week, starting at week 1. The directory is read only, meaning that you will have to copy the homework to your home directory. First, open a terminal in Jupyter Lab on Anvil, then type

[source,bash]
----
cp -r /anvil/projects/tdm/seminar/1/ $HOME/seminar/1/
----
 
where your $HOME directory is something like /home/x-myusername. 

For week 2, the homework would be retrieved similarly using

[source,bash]
----
cp -r /anvil/projects/tdm/seminar/2/ $HOME/seminar/2/
----

== 2. Finish the Homework

From here, you can begin working on the homework by opening it up at the file explorer window in Jupyter Lab (inside the folder titled `seminar`).

If you make a mistake, you can always retrieve the original homework template using the command from step 1. However, **be sure to either move your edited notebook to somewhere else, or copy the homework template with a new destination**, such as

[source,bash]
----
cp -r /anvil/projects/tdm/seminar/1/ $HOME/seminar/1/new/
----

because otherwise you might overwrite your progress!

== 3. Submit to Gradescope

Go to Gradescope and submit the code like usual - the rules at https://the-examples-book.com/projects/current-projects/submissions apply!

Part of these rules include uploading both the homework with answers in a .ipynb, as well as (for these homeworks) the corresponding Python code in a .py script. You can manually strip the Python code from the notebook and upload that; alternatively there is a way to convert a .ipynb file directly to a .py for upload, but you will have to do it on your local machine (not on Anvil).
