= TDM 30100: Project 11 -- 2022

**Motivation:** One of the primary ways to get and interact with data today is via APIs. APIs provide a way to access data and functionality from other applications. There are 3 very popular types of APIs that you will likely encounter in your work: RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, and gRPC APIs. Our focus for the remainder of the semester will be on RESTful APIs.

**Context:** We are working on a series of projects that focus on building and using RESTful APIs. We will learn some basics about interacting and using APIs, and even build our own API.

**Scope:** Python, APIs, requests, fastapi

.Learning Objectives
****
- Understand and use the HTTP methods with the `requests` library.
- Write REST APIs using the `fastapi` library to deliver data and functionality to a client.
- Identify the various components of a URL.
