= TDM 40100: Project 2 -- 2022

**Motivation:** The ability to use SQL to query data in a relational database is an extremely useful skill. What is even more useful is the ability to build a `sqlite3` database, design a schema, insert data, create indexes, etc. This series of projects is focused around SQL, `sqlite3`, with the opportunity to use other skills you've built throughout the previous years.

**Context:** In TDM 20100 (formerly STAT 29000), you had the opportunity to learn some basics of SQL, and likely worked (at least partially) with `sqlite3` -- a powerful database engine. In this project (and following projects), we will branch into SQL and `sqlite3`-specific topics and techniques that you haven't yet had exposure to in The Data Mine.

**Scope:** `sqlite3`, lmod, SQL

.Learning Objectives
****
- Create your own `sqlite3` database file.
- Analyze a large dataset and formulate `CREATE TABLE` statements designed to store the data.
- Insert data into your database.
- Run one or more queries to test out the end result.
