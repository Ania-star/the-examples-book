= TDM 10100: Project 13 -- 2022

**Motivation:** This semester we took a deep dive into `R` and it's packages. Lets take a second to pat ourselves on the back for surviving a long semester and review what we have learned! 

Make sure to read about, and use the template found xref:templates.adoc[here], and the important information about projects submissions xref:submissions.adoc[here].

== Dataset(s)

The following questions will use the following dataset(s):

- /anvil/projects/tdm/data/beer/beers.csv

== Questions

=== ONE
Read in the dataset and into a data.frame called `beer`
[loweralpha]
. What is the file size, how many rows, columns and type of data?
. What is the average score for a `stout`? (consider a stout any named beer from the column `name` with the word `stout` in it)
. How many `Pale Ale's` are on this list? (consider a stout any named beer from the column `name` with the word `pale` and `ale` in it)

. Using the unique function on the availablity column. Why is there different labels that are technically the same?
